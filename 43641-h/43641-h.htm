<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>

<hr style="width: 8%;">
<p><span class="firstwords">It</span> will be many years before a complete history
of the operations of the armies of the Union
can be written; but that is not a sufficient reason
why historical pictures may not now be
painted from such materials as have come to
hand. This volume, therefore, is a sketch of the
operations of the Army of the Potomac from
August, 1861, to November, 1862, while commanded
by General McClellan. To avoid detail,
the organization of the army is given in an Appendix.
It has not been possible, in a book of
this size, to give the movements of regiments;
but the narrative has been limited to the operations
of brigades and divisions. It will be comparatively
easy, however, for the reader to ascertain
the general position of any regiment in the
different battles, by consulting the Appendix in
connection with the narrative.</p>

<p>For more than three years I have followed the
flag of our country in the East and in the West
and in the South,&mdash;on the ocean, on the land, and
on the great rivers. A year ago I gave in a volume
entitled "My Days and Nights on the Battle-Field"
a description of the Battle of Bull Run,
and other battles in Kentucky, Tennessee, and on
the Mississippi.</p>

<p>It has been my privilege to witness nearly all
the great battles fought by the Army of the Potomac,&mdash;Antietam,
Fredericksburg, Gettysburg, at
the Wilderness, Spottsylvania, the North Anna,
Coal Harbor and at Petersburg. Letters have
been received from those who are strangers to
me as well as from friends, expressing a desire
that I should give a connected account, not only
of the operations of that army, from its organization,
but of other armies; also of the glorious
achievements of the navy in this great struggle of
our country for national existence. The present
volume, therefore, will be the second of the contemplated
series.</p>

<p>During the late campaign in Virginia, many
facts and incidents were obtained which give an
insight into the operations of the armies of the
South, not before known. Time will undoubtedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
reveal other important facts, which will be made
use of in the future. It will be my endeavor to
sift from the immense amount of material already
accumulated a concise and trustworthy
account, that we may know how our patriot brothers
have fought to save the country and to secure
to all who may live after them the blessings
of a free government.</p>

<h3>ORGANIZATION OF THE ARMY OF THE POTOMAC.</h3>


<p><span class="firstwords">The</span> battle of Bull Run, or of Manassas, as the
Rebels call it, which was fought on the 21st of
July, 1861, was the first great battle of the war.
It was disastrous to the Union army. But the
people of the North were not disheartened by it.
Their pride was mortified, for they had confidently
expected a victory, and had not taken into
consideration the possibility of a defeat. The
victory was all but won, as has been narrated in
"My Days and Nights on the Battle-Field," when
the arrival of a brigade of Rebels and the great
mistake of Captain Barry, who supposed them to
be Union troops, turned the scale, and the battle
was lost to the Union army.</p>

<p>But the people of the North, who loved the
Union, could not think of giving up the contest,&mdash;of
having the country divided, and the old flag
trailed in the dust. They felt that it would be
impossible to live peaceably side by side with
those who declared themselves superior to the
laboring men of the Free States, and were their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
rightful masters. They were not willing to acknowledge
that the slaveholders were their masters.
They felt that there could not be friendship
and amity between themselves and a nation
which had declared that slavery was its cornerstone.
Besides all this, the slaveholders wanted
Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri in the Southern
Confederacy, while the majority of the people
of those States wanted to stay in the Union.
The Rebels professed that they were willing that
each State should choose for itself, but they were
insincere and treacherous in their professions.
Kentucky would not join the Confederacy; therefore
they invaded the State to compel the people
to forsake the old flag.</p>

<p>A gentleman from Ohio accompanied a Southern
lady to Columbus, on the Mississippi, to see
her safely among her friends. General Polk was
commander of the Rebel forces at that place, and
they talked about the war.</p>

<p>"I wish it might be settled," said the General.</p>

<p>"How will you settle?"</p>

<p>"O, all we ask is to have all that belongs to
us, and to be let alone."</p>

<p>"What belongs to you?"</p>

<p>"All that has always been acknowledged as
ours."</p>

<p>"Do you want Missouri?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that is ours."</p>

<p>"Do you want Kentucky?"</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly. The Ohio River has always
been considered as the boundary line."</p>

<p>"But Kentucky don't want you."</p>

<p>"We must have her."</p>

<p>"You want all of Virginia?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"You want Maryland?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly."</p>

<p>"What will you do with Washington?"</p>

<p>"We don't want it. Remove it if you want to;
but Maryland is ours."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>Such was the conversation; and this feeling,
that they must have all the Slave States to form
a great slaveholding confederacy, was universal
in the South.</p>

<p>Besides this, they held the people in the Free
States in contempt. Even the children of the
South were so influenced by the system of slavery
that they thought themselves superior to the
people of the Free States who worked for a
living.</p>

<p>I heard a girl, who was not more than ten
years old, say that the Northern people were all
"old scrubs"! Not to be a scrub was to own
slaves,&mdash;to work them hard and pay them nothing,&mdash;to
sell them, to raise children for the
market,&mdash;to separate mothers from their babes,
wives from their husbands,&mdash;to live solely for
their own interests, happiness, and pleasure,
without regard to the natural rights of others.
This little girl, although her mother kept a boarding-house,
felt that she was too good to play with
Northern children, or if she noticed them at all,
it was as a superior.</p>

<p>Feeling themselves the superiors of the Northern
people, having been victorious at Manassas,
the people of the South became enthusiastic for
continuing the war. Thousands of volunteers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
joined the Rebels already in arms. Before the
summer of 1861 had passed, General Johnston
had a large army in front of Washington, which
was called the Army of the Potomac.</p>

<p>At the same time thousands rushed to arms
in the North. They saw clearly that there was
but one course to pursue,&mdash;to fight it out, defeat
the Rebels, vindicate their honor, and save
the country.</p>

<p>The Union army which gathered at Washington
was also styled the Army of the Potomac.
Many of the soldiers who fought at Manassas
were three months' men. As their terms of service
expired their places were filled by men who
enlisted for three years, if not sooner discharged.</p>

<p>General George B.&nbsp;McClellan, who with General
Rosecrans had been successfully conducting
the war in Western Virginia, was called to
Washington to organize an army which, it was
hoped, would defeat the Rebels, and move on to
Richmond.</p>

<p>The people wanted a leader. General Scott,
who had fought at Niagara and Lundy's Lane,
who had captured the city of Mexico, was too
old and infirm to take the field. General McDowell,
although his plan of attack at Bull Run
was approved, had failed of victory. General
McClellan had been successful in the skirmishes
at Philippi and at Rich Mountain. He was
known to be a good engineer. He had been a
visitor to Russia during the Crimean war, and
had written a book upon that war, which was
published by Congress. He was a native of Pennsylvania
and a resident of Ohio when the war
broke out. The governors of both of those States<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
sent him a commission as a brigadier-general,
because he had had military experience in
Mexico, and because he was known as a military
man, and because they were in great need of experienced
men to command the troops. Having
all these things in his favor, he was called to
Washington and made commander of the Army
of the Potomac on the 27th of July.</p>

<p>He immediately submitted a plan of operations
to the President for suppressing the rebellion.
He thought that if Kentucky remained loyal,
twenty thousand men moving down the Mississippi
would be sufficient to quell the rebellion
in the West. Western Virginia could be held
by five or ten thousand more. He would have
ten thousand protect the Baltimore and Ohio
Railroad and the Potomac River, five thousand
at Baltimore, twenty thousand at Washington,
and three thousand at Fortress Monroe. One
grand army for active operations was needed,
to consist of two hundred and twenty-five thousand
infantry, six hundred pieces of field artillery,
twenty-five thousand cavalry, and seven
thousand five hundred engineers, making a total
of two hundred and seventy-three thousand men.
In his letter to the President, General McClellan
says: "I propose, with the force which I have requested,
not only to drive the enemy out of Virginia,
and occupy Richmond, but to occupy
Charleston, Savannah, Montgomery, Pensacola,
Mobile, and New Orleans; in other words, to
move into the heart of the enemy's country, and
crush the rebellion in its very <a name="tn_png_16"></a><!--TN: Comma changed to a period after "heart" on Page 15-->heart."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>
<p>It was found a very difficult matter to obtain
arms for the soldiers; for President Buchanan's
Secretary of War, Floyd, had sent most of the
arms in Northern arsenals to the South before
the war commenced. But, notwithstanding this,
so earnest were the people, and so energetic the
government, that on the 1st of October, two
months from the time that General McClellan
took command, there were one hundred and sixty-eight
thousand men in the Army of the Potomac,
with two hundred and twenty pieces of artillery;
besides this, the government had a large army in
Kentucky, and another in Missouri. The Rebels
had large armies in those States, and were making
great efforts to secure them to the Confederacy.
It was not possible to send all the troops
to Washington, as General McClellan desired.</p>

<p>The Rebel army was commanded by General
Joseph E.&nbsp;Johnston. He had about seventy thousand
men, with his headquarters at Manassas.
Some of the spies which were sent out by General
McClellan reported a much larger force under
Johnston, and General McClellan believed
that he had one hundred and fifty thousand men.
Strong fortifications were erected to defend
Washington; General Johnston wished very
much to take the city, and the people of the
South expected that he would gain possession of
it and drive out the hated Yankees. He pushed
his troops almost up to General McClellan's lines,
taking possession of Munson's Hill, which is only
five miles from the Long Bridge at Washington.</p>

<p>The Rebels erected breastworks upon the hill,
and threw shot and shells almost to Arlington
House. From the hill they could see the spires of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the city of Washington, the white dome of the
capitol, and its marble pillars. No doubt they
longed to have it in their possession; but there
were thousands of men in arms and hundreds of
cannon and a wide river between them and the
city.</p>

<p>One bright October morning I rode to Bailey's
Cross-roads, which is about a mile from Munson's
Hill. Looking across a cornfield, I could see the
Rebels behind their breastworks. Their battle-flags
were waving gayly. Their bayonets gleamed
in the sunshine. A group of officers had gathered
on the summit of the hill. With my field-glass,
I could see what they were doing. They
examined maps, looked towards Washington, and
pointed out the position of the Union fortifications.
There were ladies present, who looked
earnestly towards the city, and chatted merrily
with the officers. A few days after, I saw in a
Richmond paper that the officers were Generals
Lee, Beauregard, and Johnston, and that one of
the ladies was Mrs. Lee.</p>

<p>General Lee was within sight of his old home;
but he had become a traitor to his country, and it
was to be his no more. Never again would he sit
in the spacious parlors, or walk the verdant lawn,
or look upon the beautiful panorama of city and
country, forest and field, hill and valley, land
and water,&mdash;upon the ripened wheat on the hillside
or the waving corn in the meadows,&mdash;upon
the broad Potomac, gleaming in the sunshine, or
upon the white-winged ships sailing upon its
bosom,&mdash;upon the city, with its magnificent buildings,
upon the marble shaft rising to the memory
of Washington, or upon the outline of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
hills of Bladensburg, faint and dim in the distance.</p>

<p>He joined the rebellion because he believed that
a state was more than the nation, that Virginia
was greater than the Union, that she had a right
to leave it, and was justified in seceding from it.
He belonged to an old family, which, when Virginia
was a colony of Great Britain, had influence
and power. He owned many slaves. He believed
that the institution of slavery was right. He left
the Union to serve Virginia, resigned his command
as colonel of cavalry, which he held under
the United States. He accepted a commission
from Jefferson Davis, forswore his allegiance to
his country, turned his back upon the old flag,
proved recreant in the hour of trial, and became
an enemy to the nation which had trusted and
honored him.</p>

<p>The summer passed away and the golden months
of autumn came round. The troops were organized
into brigades and divisions. They were
drilled daily. In the morning at six o'clock the
drummers beat the reveille. The soldiers sprang
to their feet at the sound, and formed in company
lines to answer the roll-call. Then they had
breakfast of hard-tack and coffee. After breakfast
the guards were sent out. At eight o'clock
there were company drills in marching, in handling
their muskets, in charging bayonet, and resisting
an imaginary onset from the enemy. At
twelve o'clock they had dinner,&mdash;more hard-tack,
pork or beef, or rice and molasses. In the afternoon
there were regimental, brigade, and sometimes
division drills,&mdash;the men carrying their
knapsacks, canteens, haversacks, and blankets,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>just as if they were on the march. At sunset
each regiment had a dress parade. Then each
soldier was expected to be in his best trim. In
well-disciplined regiments, all wore white gloves
when they appeared on dress parade. It was a
fine sight,&mdash;the long line of men in blue, the ranks
straight and even, each soldier doing his best.
Marching proudly to the music of the band, the
light of the setting sun falling aslant upon their
bright bayonets, and the flag they loved waving
above them, thrilling them with remembrances of
the glorious deeds of their fathers, who bore
it aloft at Saratoga, Trenton, and Princeton, at
Queenstown and New Orleans, at Buena Vista
and Chapultepec, who beneath its endearing folds
laid the foundations of the nation and secured
the rights of civil and religious liberty. Each
soldier felt that he would be an unworthy son,
if traitors and rebels were permitted to overthrow
a government which had cost so much
sacrifice and blood and treasure, and which was
the hope of the oppressed throughout all the
world.</p>

<p>In the evening there were no military duties to
be performed, and the soldiers told stories around
the camp-fires, or sang songs, or had a dance; for
in each company there was usually one who could
play the violin. Many merry times they had.
Some sat in their tents and read the newspapers
or whatever they could find to interest them,
with a bayonet stuck in the ground for a candle-stick.
There were some who, at home, had attended
the Sabbath school. Although in camp,
they did not forget what they had left behind.
The Bible was precious to them. They read its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
sacred pages and treasured its holy truths.
Sometimes they had a prayer-meeting, and asked
God to bless them, the friends they had left behind,
and the country for which they were ready
to die, if need be, to save it from destruction.</p>

<p>But at the tap of the drum at nine o'clock the
laughter, the songs, the dances, the stories, the
readings, and the prayer-meetings, all were
brought to a close, the lights were put out, and
silence reigned throughout the camp, broken only
by the step of the watchful sentinel.</p>

<p>The soldiers soon grew weary of this monotony.
They had been accustomed to an active life. It
was an army different from any ever before
organized. It was composed in a great degree of
thinking men. Many of them were leading citizens
in the towns where they lived. They were
well educated and were refined in their manners.
They knew there was to be hard fighting and a
desperate contest, that many never would return
to their homes, but would find their graves upon
the field of battle; yet they were ready to meet
the enemy, and waited impatiently for orders to
march.</p>

<p>There were grand reviews of troops during the
fall, by which the officers and soldiers became
somewhat accustomed to moving in large bodies.
All of the troops which could be spared from the
fortifications and advanced <a name="tn_png_21"></a><!--TN: Comma removed after "positions" on Page 20-->positions were
brought together at Bailey's Cross-roads, after
the Rebels evacuated Munson's Hill, to be reviewed
by the President and General McClellan.
There were seventy thousand men. It was a
grand sight. Each regiment tried to outdo all
others in its appearance and its marching. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
moved by companies past the President, bands
playing national airs, the drums beating, and the
flags waving. There were several hundred pieces
of artillery, and several thousand cavalrymen.
The ground shook beneath the steady marching of
the great mass of men, and the tread of thousands
of hoofs. It was the finest military display ever
seen in America.</p>

<p>It was expected that the army would soon move
upon the enemy. General McClellan, in a letter
to the President, advised that the advance should
not be postponed later than the 25th of November.
The time passed rapidly. The roads were smooth
and hard. The days were golden with sunshine,
and the stars shone from a cloudless sky at night;
but there were no movements during the month,
except reconnaissances by brigades and divisions.</p>

<p>The Rebels erected batteries on the south side
of the Potomac, below the Occoquan, and blockaded
it. They had destroyed the Baltimore and
Ohio Railroad and the Chesapeake Canal, so that
the Union army and the city of Washington were
dependent on the one line of railroad to Baltimore
for all its supplies. It was very desirable
that the Potomac should be opened. General
Hooker, who commanded a division at Budd's
Ferry, wished very much to attack the Rebels,
with the aid of the navy, and capture the batteries,
but General McClellan did not wish one
division to move till the whole army was ready.
December passed, and the year completed its
round. Cold nights and blustering days came,
and the army, numbering two hundred thousand
men, went into winter quarters.</p>

<h3>BALL'S BLUFF.</h3>


<p><span class="firstwords">There</span> were but two events of importance during
the long period of inactivity in the autumn
of 1861,&mdash;a disaster at Ball's Bluff and a victory
at Dranesville.</p>

<p>In October General Stone's division of the
Army of the Potomac was at Poolesville in Maryland.
General Banks's division was at Darnestown,
between Poolesville and Washington.
General McCall's division was at a little hamlet
called Lewinsville, on the turnpike leading from
the chain bridge to Leesburg, on the Virginia
side. The main body of the Rebels was at Centreville,
but there was a brigade at Leesburg.</p>

<p>It is a beautiful and fertile country around
that pleasant Virginia town. West of the town
are high hills, called the Catoctin Mountains.
If we were standing on their summits, and looking
east, we should see the town of Leesburg at
our feet. It is a place of three or four thousand
inhabitants. There are several churches, a court-house,
a market-place, where, before the war, the
farmers sold their wheat, and corn, oats, and
garden vegetables. Three miles east of the town
we behold the Potomac sparkling in the sunlight,
its current divided by Harrison's Island. The
distance from the Virginia shore to the island is
about one hundred and eighty feet; from the
island to the Maryland shore it is six or seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
hundred feet. The bank on the Virginia side is
steep, and seventy-five or eighty feet high, and is
called Ball's Bluff. A canal runs along the Maryland
shore. Four miles below the island is Edward's
Ferry, and three miles east of it is Poolesville.</p>

<p>In October, General McClellan desired to make
a movement which would compel General Evans,
commanding the Rebels at Leesburg, to leave the
place. He therefore directed General McCall to
move up to Dranesville, on the Leesburg turnpike.
Such a movement would threaten to cut General
Evans off from Centreville. At the same time he
sent word to General Stone, that if he were to
make a demonstration towards Leesburg it might
drive them away.</p>

<p>On Sunday night, at sundown, October 20th,
General Stone ordered Colonel Devens of the
Massachusetts Fifteenth to send a squad of men
across the river, to see if there were any Rebels
in and around Leesburg.</p>

<p>Captain Philbrick, with twenty men of that
regiment, crossed in three small boats, hauled
them upon the bank, went up the bluff by a
winding path, moved cautiously through the
woods, also through a cornfield, and went within
a mile and a half of Leesburg, seeing no pickets,
hearing no alarm. But the men saw what they
thought was an encampment. They returned at
midnight and reported to General Stone, who
ordered Colonel Devens to go over with about
half of his regiment and hold the bluff.</p>

<p>The only means which General Stone had for
crossing troops was one flat-boat, an old ferry-boat,
and three small boats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>Colonel Devens embarked his men on the boats
about three o'clock in the morning. The soldiers
pushed them to the foot of the bluff, then
returned for other detachments. The men went
up the path and formed in line on the top of the
bluff. By daybreak he had five companies on the
Virginia shore. He moved through the open
field towards the encampment which Captain
Philbrick and his men had seen, as they thought,
but which proved to be only an opening in the
woods. But just as the sun's first rays were lighting
the Catoctin hills he came upon the Rebel
pickets in the woods beyond the field. The pickets
fired a few shots and fled towards Leesburg,
giving the alarm.</p>

<p>The town was soon in commotion. The drums
beat, the Rebel troops then rushed out of their
tents and formed in line, and the people of the
town jumped from their breakfast-tables at the
startling cry, "The Yankees are coming!"</p>

<p>General Evans, the Rebel commander, the day
before had moved to Goose Creek to meet General
McCall, if he should push beyond Dranesville.
He had the Eighth Virginia, the Thirteenth,
Seventeenth, and Eighteenth Mississippi Regiments,
and a squadron of cavalry and four pieces
of artillery.</p>

<p>Captain Duff, commanding a detachment of
the Seventeenth Mississippi, was left at Leesburg.
As soon as Colonel Devens's advance was discovered,
he formed his men in the woods and sent
word to General Evans, who hastened with his
whole brigade to the spot.</p>

<p>General Stone placed Colonel Baker, commanding
the First California Regiment, in command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
of the forces upon the Virginia side of the river.
Colonel Baker was a Senator from Oregon,&mdash;a
noble man, an eloquent orator, a patriot, and as
brave as he was patriotic. During the forenoon
a portion of the Twentieth Massachusetts Regiment,
commanded by Colonel Lee, was sent over.</p>

<p>Just before twelve o'clock General Stone sent
word to Colonel Baker that the force of the enemy
was supposed to be about four thousand. Colonel
Baker was in doubt whether to remain or
whether to send over more troops; but word
came to him that the Rebels were advancing, and
he ordered over the Tammany Regiment of New
York troops, commanded by Colonel Cogswell,
and Lieutenant-Colonel Wistar's California Regiment.
Colonel Baker went over about two o'clock
in the afternoon. By constant effort, he succeeded
in getting about seventeen hundred men
over during the day, and three cannon,&mdash;two
mountain howitzers and one rifled gun. It was
nearly three o'clock in the afternoon before General
Evans began the attack. He had captured a
courier the day before, sent by General McCall
to General Meade, and from the despatches
learned that General McCall was only making a
reconnaissance. This information led him to
bring all his forces back to Leesburg, and it also
delayed his attack until late in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Captain Duff, of the Seventeenth Mississippi,
was reinforced first by four companies of the
Thirteenth and Eighteenth Mississippi, commanded
by Colonel Jennifer. About two o'clock
the Eighth Virginia arrived from Goose Creek,
commanded by Colonel Huntoon. Other reinforcements
were near at hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"Drive the Yankees into the river!" was General
Evans's order.</p>

<p>He had the advantage of position, being on
higher ground than that occupied by Colonel
Baker. But he advanced very cautiously.</p>

<p>Colonel Baker formed his men on the eastern
border of the field in the edge of the woods.
The Fifteenth Massachusetts was on the right,&mdash;next
there was a portion of the Twentieth Massachusetts,
which had been sent over, and then
the California and Tammany regiments. The
Rebels began to fire at long range. Some of
them climbed into the trees,&mdash;some secreted themselves
in the shocks of corn which were standing
in the field,&mdash;some crouched behind the fences
and trees. Colonel Baker, to save his men, ordered
them to lie down.</p>

<p>Colonel Jennifer, commanding a Rebel regiment,
with a party of skirmishers, went round
the north side of the field and came upon the
Fifteenth Massachusetts, but the men of that
regiment fired so steadily that the Rebels were
forced to retire.</p>

<p>At the southwest corner of the field was a farm
road, down which the Rebels advanced. The
howitzers and the cannon were placed in position
to rake that road, and the Rebels were compelled
to leave it and form in the woods.</p>

<p>It was apparent to Colonel Baker and all of his
command at three o'clock that the Rebels outnumbered
them, but they prepared to make a
brave fight. The fire from both sides began to be
more fierce and rapid.</p>

<p>At this time General Gorman had crossed the
river at Edward's Ferry, three miles below, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
fifteen hundred men. General Evans, to prevent
a junction of the Union forces, moved his troops
into a ravine, and came upon the left flank of
Colonel Baker's command.</p>

<p>"I want to find out what the Rebels are doing
out there," said Colonel Baker to Colonel Wistar,
"and I want you to send out two companies."</p>

<p>Colonel Wistar sent out Captain Marco with
one company, and went himself with the other.
About fifty yards in front of Colonel Wistar was
a hill, and behind this Evans was preparing to
make a charge. Suddenly the Eighth Virginia,
who had been lying upon the ground, sprang to
their feet, and, without firing a shot, advanced
upon Captain Marco. His men, without waiting
for orders, fired, and for fifteen minutes there was
a very hot time of it,&mdash;the two companies holding
their ground against the superior force. Captain
Marco had deployed his men as skirmishers, while
the Virginians were in close rank, and so destructive
was the fire from Captain Marco's command,
that the Rebel lines gave way.</p>

<p>But it was at a fearful cost that the brave men
held their ground so long. During this time all
their officers, and all their corporals and sergeants
but three, and two-thirds of the men, were
killed or wounded! They fell back at last under
command of a sergeant, carrying with them a
lieutenant and fourteen men of the Eighth Virginia
prisoners.</p>

<p>The Rebels having reformed their line, came
down upon the left flank of the California regiment.
Colonel Wistar saw them in the ravine,
faced four of his companies to meet them, and
gave them a volley which threw them into con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>fusion,
and, after firing a few scattering shots,
they ran up the ravine, and disappeared behind
the hill.</p>

<p>For an hour or more the firing was at long
range, each party availing themselves of the shelter
of the woods. The men were ordered by
Colonel Baker to shield themselves as much as
possible, but himself and the other officers stood
boldly out in the hottest fire.</p>

<p>"That is pretty close!" said Colonel Baker to
Colonel Wistar, as a bullet came between them.
Soon another ball cut off a twig over Colonel
Baker's head.</p>

<p>"That fellow means <i>us</i>," he said, pointing to a
Rebel in a distant tree. "Boys, do you see him?
Now some of you try him," he said to company
C, of Colonel Wistar's regiment. The soldiers
singled out the man, who soon tumbled from the
tree. He repeatedly cautioned his men about
exposing themselves. He wanted to save them
for the final conflict, which he knew must come
before long.</p>

<p>"Lie close, don't expose yourself," he said to
a brave soldier who was deliberately loading and
firing.</p>

<p>"Colonel, you expose yourself, and why
shouldn't I?"</p>

<p>"Ah! my son, when you get to be a United
States senator and a colonel, you will feel that
you must not lie down in face of the 'enemy.'"</p>

<p>He knew that it would be asked if he was brave
in the hour of battle. It was his duty to expose
himself, to show his men and all the world that
he was not afraid to meet the enemy, and was
worthy of the position he held.</p>

<p>One of the Mississippi regiments tried again to
outflank Colonel Baker's left. The Rebels came
within fifty feet of the California regiment; but
the constant and steady fire given by that regiment
again forced them back. It was an unbroken
roll of musketry through the afternoon.
The Union soldiers held their ground manfully,
but their ammunition was giving out. The men,
as fast as their cartridge-boxes became empty,
helped themselves from the boxes of their fallen
comrades. They could not obtain reinforcements
for want of boats, although there were troops
enough upon the Maryland shore to overwhelm
the enemy. The boats were old and leaky, and
were used to carry the wounded to the island.
General Stone had taken no measures to obtain
other boats. He was at Edward's Ferry, within
sight and sound of the battle. He had fifteen hun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>dred
troops across the river at that point, and
he might have ordered their advance towards
Leesburg. They could have gained General
Evans's rear, for there was no force to oppose
them. The troops stood idly upon the bank, wondering
that they were not ordered to march. So
the brave men on the bluff, confronted by nearly
twice their number, were left to their fate.</p>

<p>"We can cut our way through to Edward's
Ferry," said Colonel Devens.</p>

<p>"If I had two more such regiments as the
Massachusetts Fifteenth, I would cut my way to
Leesburg," said Colonel Baker.</p>

<p>He went along the line encouraging the men
to hold out to the last. His cool bearing, and
the glance of his eagle eye, inspired the men and
they compelled the Rebels again and again to fall
back. Lieutenant-Colonel Wistar was wounded,
but refused to leave the field. He remained with
his men and kept a close watch upon the ravine
and the hillock at his left hand. He saw that
General Evans was making preparations for a
desperate onset. He was gathering his troops in
a mass behind the hill.</p>

<p>"Drive the Yankees into the Potomac," said
General Evans, again. He had more than two
thousand men.</p>

<p>"There is not a moment to lose. A heavy
column is behind the hill and they are getting
ready to advance," said Colonel Wistar, hastening
to Colonel Baker.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Bramhall was ordered to open upon
them with his rifled gun. He brought it into
position and fired a round or two, but two of his
cannoneers were instantly killed and five others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
wounded. Colonel Baker, Colonel Wistar, and
Colonel Cogswell used the rammer and sponges,
and aided in firing it till other cannoneers arrived.
Colonel Wistar was wounded again while
serving the gun. They could not reach the main
body of Rebels behind the hill, but kept the
others in check with canister as often as they
attempted to advance.</p>

<p>The force behind the hill suddenly came over
it, yelling and whooping like savages. Colonel
Baker was in front of his men, urging them to
resist the impending shock. He was calm and
collected, standing with his face to the foe, his
left hand in his bosom. A man sprang from the
Rebel ranks, ran up behind him, and with a self-cocking
revolver fired six bullets into him. Two
soldiers in front of him fired at the same time.
One bullet tore open his side, another passed
through his skull. Without a murmur, a groan,
or a sigh, he fell dead.</p>

<p>But as he fell, Captain Beirel of the California
regiment leaped from the ranks and blew out the
fellow's brains with his pistol.</p>

<p>There was a fierce and terrible fight. The
Californians rushed forward to save the body of
their beloved commander. They fell upon the
enemy with the fury of madmen. They thought
not of life or death. They had no fear. Each
man was a host in himself. There was a close
hand-to-hand contest, bayonet-thrusts, desperate
struggles, trials of strength. Men fell, but rose
again, bleeding, yet still fighting, driving home
the bayonet, pushing back the foe, clearing a
space around the body of the fallen hero, and
bearing it from the field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>While this contest was going on, some one said,
"Fall back to the river." Some of the soldiers
started upon the run.</p>

<p>"Stand your ground!" shouted Colonel Devens.</p>

<p>Some who had started for the river came back,
but others kept on. The line was broken, and it
was too late to recover what had been lost. They
all ran to the bank of the river. Some halted on
the edge of the bluff and formed in line, to make
another stand, but hundreds rushed down the
banks to the boats. They pushed off into the
stream, but the overloaded flat-boat was whirled
under by the swift current, and the soldiers were
thrown into the water. Some sank instantly,
others came up and clutched at sticks, thrust
their arms towards the light, and with a wild, despairing
cry went down. Some clung to floating
planks, and floated far down the river, gaining
the shore at Edward's Ferry. A few who could
swim reached the island. All the while the Rebels
from the bank poured a murderous fire upon
the struggling victims in the water and upon the
bank.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Bramhall ran his cannon down the
bank into the river, to save them from falling
into the hands of the enemy. Some of the officers
and soldiers secreted themselves in the bushes
till darkness came on, then sprung into the river
and swam to the island, and thus escaped,&mdash;reaching
it naked, chilled, exhausted, to shiver
through the long hours of a cold October night.
Of the seventeen hundred who crossed the Potomac,
nearly one half were killed, wounded, or
captured by the enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>There was great rejoicing at Leesburg that
night. The citizens who had been so frightened
in the morning when they heard that the Yankees
were coming, now illuminated their houses,
and spread a feast for the Rebel soldiers. When
the Union prisoners arrived in the town, the men
and women called them hard names, shouted
"Bull Run," "Yankee Invaders," but the men
who had fought so bravely under such disadvantages
were too noble to take any notice of the
insults. Indians seldom taunt or insult their
captives taken in war. Civilized nations everywhere
respect those whom the fortunes of war
have placed in their hands; but slavery uncivilizes
men. It makes them intolerant, imperious,
and brutal, and hence the men and women of the
South, who accepted secession, who became
traitors to their country, manifested a malignity
and fiendishness towards Union prisoners which
has no parallel in the history of civilized nations.</p>

<p>There was great rejoicing throughout the
South. It gave the leaders and fomenters of the
rebellion arguments which they used to prove
that the Yankees were cowards, and would not
fight, and that the North would soon be a conquered
nation.</p>

<p>It was a sad sight at Poolesville. Tidings of
the disaster reached the place during the evening.
The wounded began to arrive. It was heart-rending
to hear their accounts of the scene at
the river bank, when the line gave way. Hundreds
of soldiers came into the lines naked,
having thrown away everything to enable them
to swim the river. The night set in dark and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
stormy. After swimming the river, they had
crowded along the Maryland shore, through
briers, thorns, and thistles, stumbling over fallen
trees and stones in the darkness, while endeavoring
to reach their encampments. Many were
found in the woods in the morning, having fallen
through exhaustion.</p>

<p>Thus by the incompetency of those in command,
a terrible disaster was brought about. General
McClellan and General Stone were both severely
censured by the people for this needless, inexcusable
sacrifice. Grave doubts were entertained in
regard to the loyalty of General Stone, for he
permitted the wives of officers in the Rebel service
to pass into Maryland and return to Virginia,
with packages and bundles, whenever they
pleased, and he ordered his pickets to heed any
signals they might see from the Rebels, and to receive
any packages they might send, and forward
them to his quarters.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>When these facts became known to the War
Department, General Stone was arrested and
confined in Fort Warren in Boston Harbor, but
he was subsequently released, having no charges
preferred against him.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Putnam of the Twentieth Massachusetts,
who was so young that he was called
the "boy soldier," was mortally wounded in the
battle, was carried to Poolesville, where he died
the next day. He came of noble blood. His
father was descended from the ancestor of old
General Putnam, who fought the French and Indians
on the shores of Lake Champlain, who did
not stop to unyoke his oxen in the field, when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
heard of the affair at Lexington, and hastened to
meet the enemy.</p>

<p>Rev. James Freeman Clarke, at his funeral
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"His mother's family has given to us <a name="tn_png_36"></a><!--TN: "states men" changed to "statesmen" on Page 35-->statesmen,
sages, patriots, poets, scholars, orators,
economists, philanthropists, and now gives us
also a hero and a martyr. His great grandfather,
Judge Lowell, inserted in the Bill of
Rights, prefixed to the Constitution of this State,
the clause declaring that 'all men are born free
and equal,' for the purpose, as he avowed at the
time, of abolishing slavery in Massachusetts, and
he was appointed by Washington, federal judge
of the district.</p>

<p>"His grandfather was minister of this church,
[West Church, Boston,] honored and loved as
few men have been, for more than half a century.</p>

<p>"Born in Boston in 1840, he was educated in
Europe, where he went when eleven years old,
and where in France, Germany, and Italy he
showed that he possessed the ancestral faculty of
mastering easily all languages, and where he
faithfully studied classic and Christian antiquity
and art. Under the best and most loving guidance,
he read with joy the vivid descriptions of
Virgil, while looking down from the hill of Posilippo,
on the headland of Misenum, and the
ruins of Cumæ. He studied with diligence the
remains of Etruscan art, of which, perhaps, no
American scholar, though he was so young, knew
more.</p>

<p>"Thus accomplished, he returned to his native
land, but, modest and earnest, he made no display
of his acquisitions, and very few knew that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
he had acquired anything. When the war broke
out, his conscience and heart urged him to go to
the service of his country. His strong sense of
duty overcame the reluctance of his parents, and
they consented. A presentiment that he should
not return alive was very strong in his mind
and theirs, but he gave himself cheerfully, and
said, in entire strength of his purpose, that 'to
die would be easy in such a cause.' In the full
conviction of immortality he added, 'What is
death, mother? it is nothing but a step in our life.'</p>

<p>"His fidelity to every duty gained him the respect
of his superior officers, and his generous,
constant interest in his companions and soldiers
brought to him an unexampled affection. He
realized fully that this war must enlarge the area
of freedom, if it was to attain its true end,&mdash;and
in one of his last letters he expressed the
earnest prayer that it might not cease till it
opened the way for universal liberty. These
earnest opinions were connected with a feeling
of the wrong done to the African race and an
interest in its improvement. He took with him
to the war as a body servant a colored lad named
George Brown, who repaid the kindness of Lieutenant
Lowell by gratitude and faithful service.
George Brown followed his master across the Potomac
into the battle, nursed him in his tent, and
tended his remains back to Boston. Nor let the
devoted courage of Lieutenant Henry Sturgis be
forgotten, who lifted his wounded friend and comrade
from the ground, and carried him on his
back a long distance to the boat, and returned
again into the fight.</p>

<p>"Farewell, dear child, brave heart, soul of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
sweetness and fire! We shall see no more that
fair, candid brow, with its sunny hair, those sincere
eyes, that cheek flushed with the commingling
roses of modesty and courage! Go and
join the noble group of devoted souls, our heroes
and saints! Go with Ellsworth, protomartyr
of this great cause of freedom. Go with Winthrop,
poet and soldier, our Korner, with sword
and lyre. Go with the chivalric Lyon, bravest
of the brave, leader of men. Go with Baker, to
whose utterance the united murmurs of Atlantic
and Pacific Oceans gave eloquent rhythm, and
whose words flowed so early into heroic action.
Go with our noble Massachusetts boys, in whose
veins runs the best blood of the age!"</p>

<p>I saw Colonel Baker often as I rode through the
army. He had a great love for his soldiers. I
had a long talk with him a few days before his
death. He felt keenly the humiliations which had
come upon the nation at Bull Run, but was confident
that in the next battle the soldiers would
redeem their good name.</p>

<p>Colonel Baker was mourned for by the whole
nation. Eloquent eulogies were pronounced upon
him in the Senate of the United States. It was
on the 11th of December, and President Lincoln
was present to do honor to the dead.</p>

<p>Senator McDougall spoke of his noble character,
his great gifts, his love of music and poetry.
Many years before they were out together upon
the plains of the West riding at night, and Colonel
Baker recited the "Battle of Ivry" as if in
anticipation of the hour when he was to stand
upon the battle-field:&mdash;</p>

<p>Senator Summer said of him:&mdash;</p>

so instantly that he passed without pain from
the service of his country to the service of his
God, while with him was more than one gallant
youth, the hope of family and friends, sent forth
by my own honored Commonwealth. It is sweet

crown of the patriot soldier's life."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<h3>BATTLE OF DRANESVILLE AND THE WINTER OF 1862.</h3>


<p><span class="firstwords">On</span> the old turnpike which leads from the
Chain Bridge above Georgetown to Leesburg
there is a hamlet of a half-dozen houses, called
Dranesville. The great road to Alexandria joins
the turnpike there, also a road which leads to
Centreville. Near the junction of the roads, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
the west side of the turnpike, there is a large
brick house, a fine old Virginia mansion, owned
by Mr. Thornton, surrounded by old trees. Just
beyond Mr. Thornton's, as we go toward Leesburg,
is Mr. Coleman's store, and a small church.
Doctor Day's house is opposite the store. There
are other small, white-washed houses scattered
along the roadside, and years ago, before the
Alexandria and Leesburg railroad was built, before
Virginia gave up the cultivation of corn and
wheat for the raising of negroes for the South,
it was a great highway. Stage-coaches filled with
passengers rumbled over the road, and long lines
of canvas-covered wagons, like a moving caravan.</p>

<p>It is a rich and fertile country. The fields of
Loudon are ever verdant; there are no hillsides
more sunny or valleys more pleasant. Wheat
and corn and cattle are raised in great abundance.</p>

<p>On the 20th of December, 1861, General
McCall, whose division of Union troops was at
Lewinsville, sent General Ord with a brigade and
a large number of wagons to Dranesville to gather
forage. On the same morning the Rebel General
Stuart started from Centreville with a brigade
bound on the same errand.</p>

<p>General Ord had the Sixth, Ninth, Tenth, and
Twelfth Regiments of Pennsylvania Reserves,
with four guns of Easton's battery, and a company
of cavalry. One of the regiments wore
bucktails in their caps instead of plumes. The
soldiers of that regiment were excellent marksmen.
They were from the Alleghany Mountains,
and often had the valleys and forests and hillsides
rung with the crack of their rifles. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
had hunted the deer, the squirrels, and partridges,
and could bring down a squirrel from the
tallest tree by their unerring aim.</p>

<p>General Stuart had the First Kentucky, Sixth
South Carolina, Tenth Alabama, Eleventh Virginia,
with the First South Carolina Battery,
commanded by Captain Cutts, also a company of
cavalry. The two forces were nearly equal.</p>

<p>General Ord started early in the morning.
The ground was frozen, the air was clear, there
was a beautiful sunshine, and the men marched
cheerily along the road, thinking of the chickens
and turkeys which might fall into their hands,
and would be very acceptable for Christmas dinners.
They reached Difficult Creek at noon
where the troops halted, kindled their fires,
cooked their coffee, ate their beef and bread, and
then pushed on towards Dranesville.</p>

<p>An officer of the cavalry came back in haste
from the advance, and reported having seen a
rebel cavalryman.</p>

<p>"Keep a sharp lookout," was the order. The
column moved on; but General Ord was prudent
and threw out companies of flankers, who
threaded their way through the woods, keeping a
sharp eye for Rebels, for they had heard that the
enemy was near at hand.</p>

<p>On reaching Dranesville, General Ord sent a
company down the Centreville road to reconnoitre.
It was not long before they reported that
the woods were full of Rebels. General Ord
formed his men on both sides of the Centreville
road. He sent the Ninth and Twelfth west of
Mr. Thornton's house, into the woods, posted the
Bucktails in front of the house, put three of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Easton's guns into position on a hill east of it,
put the Tenth Regiment and the cavalry in rear
of the battery on the Chain Bridge road, sent
one cannon down the Chain Bridge road a short
distance to open a flank fire, and directed the
Sixth Regiment to take position west of the Centreville
road, to support the Bucktails, and detached
one company of the Tenth to move down
the Alexandria road to cover the flanking cannon.</p>

<p>Standing by Thornton's house, and looking
south, we see the Rebels on a hill, about half a
mile distant. General Stuart plants his six guns
on both sides of the road, to fire toward the
Bucktails. The Eleventh Virginia and Tenth
Alabama are deployed on the right of the road,
and the Sixth South Carolina and the First Kentucky
are sent to the left. The cavalry is drawn
up behind the battery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>Having defeated the Yankees at Manassas and
Ball's Bluff, the rebel soldiers were confident that
they would win an easy victory. As soon as General
Stuart formed his line, Cutt's Battery
opened fire, sending shells down the road towards
the Bucktails. The guns were not well aimed
and did no damage. Easton's battery was hurried
up from the turnpike. So eager were the
artillerymen to get into position, that one gun
was upset, and the men were obliged to lift it
from the ground. But General Ord told the men
where to place the guns. He jumped from his
horse and sighted them so accurately, that they
threw their shells with great precision into the
Rebel ranks. The cannonade went on for a half-hour,
Easton's shells tearing the Rebel ranks,
while those fired by the Rebels did no damage
whatever. One of Easton's shells went through
a Rebel caisson, which exploded and killed several
men and horses. So severe was his fire,
that, although the Rebels had two more guns
than he, they were obliged to retreat.</p>

<p>Meanwhile General Ord's infantry advanced.
The Ninth came upon the First Kentucky in
the woods. The pines were very dense, shutting
out completely the rays of the winter sun, then
low down in the western horizon. At the same
time the Bucktails were advancing directly
south. The men of the Ninth, when they discovered
the Rebels, thought they were the Bucktails.</p>

<p>"Don't fire on us,&mdash;we are your friends!"
shouted a Rebel.</p>

<p>"Are you the Bucktails?" asked one of the
Ninth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes!" was the reply, followed by a terrific
volley from the Rebel line.</p>

<p>The Ninth, though deceived, were not thrown
into confusion. They gave an answering volley.
The Bucktails hearing the firing advanced, while
the Twelfth followed, the Ninth supporting them.</p>

<p>Upon the other side of the road a body of
Rebels had taken shelter in a house. "Let them
fellows have some shells," was the order to the
gunners.</p>

<p>Crash! crash! went the shells into and through
the house, smashing in the sides, knocking two
rooms into one, strewing the floor with laths
and plaster, and making the house smoke with
dust. The Rebels came out in a hurry, and took
shelter behind the fences, trees, and outbuildings.</p>

<p>"Colonel, I wish you to advance and drive
back those fellows," said General Ord to the
commander of the Sixth Regiment.</p>

<p>Captain Easton ordered his gunners to cease
firing, for fear of injuring the advancing troops.
The Sixth moved rapidly across the field, firing
as they advanced. The Rebels behind the fences
fired a volley, but so wild was their aim that
nearly all the bullets passed over the heads of
the Sixth. In the field and in the woods there
was a constant rattle of musketry. The men on
both sides sheltered themselves behind trees and
fences, or crept like Indians through the almost
impenetrable thickets.</p>

<p>The Bucktails were accustomed to creeping
through the forests, and taking partridges and
pigeons on the wing. Their fire was very destructive
to the enemy. Stuart's lines began to
waver before them. The South Carolinians fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
back a little, and then a little more, as the Bucktails
kept edging on. The fire of the skilled
mountaineers was constant and steady. It was
too severe for the Rebels to withstand. They
gave way suddenly on all sides, and fled in wild
confusion down the Centreville road, throwing
away their guns, clothing, knapsacks, and cartridge-boxes,
leaving one caisson and limber of
their artillery behind in their haste to get away.
Nearly all of their severely wounded were left
on the field. The Union loss was seven killed
and sixty-one wounded, while so destructive was
the fire of the Pennsylvanians that the Rebel loss
was two hundred and thirty.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>The affair, though short, was decisive. The
effect was thrilling throughout the army. The
Union troops,&mdash;held in contempt by the Rebels,&mdash;defeated
at Manassas, Ball's Bluff, and at
Bethel, by superior forces, had met an equal
number of the enemy, and in a fair fight had
won a signal victory. It was a proud day to the
brave men who had thus shown their ability to
conquer a foe equal in numbers. They returned
from Dranesville in high spirits, and were received
with cheers, long and loud, by their comrades,
who had heard the distant firing, and who
had been informed of their victory.</p>

<p>Christmas came. The men were in winter
quarters, and merry times they had,&mdash;dinners
of roast turkey, plum-pudding and mince-pies,
sent by their friends at home. After dinner they
had games, sports, and dances, chasing a greased
pig, climbing a greasy pole, running in a meal-bag,
playing ball, pitching quoits, playing leap-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>frog,
singing and dancing, around the camp-fires
through the long Christmas evening.</p>

<p>The winter passed away without any event to
break the monotony of camp-life.</p>

<p>Officers and soldiers alike became disaffected
at the long delay of General McClellan. The
President and the people also were dissatisfied.
President Lincoln, being commander-in-chief,
selected the 22d of February, the birthday of
Washington, on which all the armies of the
Union were to make an advance upon the enemy;
but it was midwinter, the roads were deep with
mud, and the order was withdrawn. General
Grant all the while was winning victories at
Fort Henry and Fort Donelson, and General
Sherman and the navy had taken Port Royal,
while the great Army of the Potomac, on which
the country had lavished its means, and granted
all that its commander asked for, was doing
nothing.</p>

<p>The President, in March, issued an order to
General McClellan to complete the organization
of the army into corps, with such promptness
and despatch as not to delay the commencement
of the operations which he had already directed
to be undertaken by the Army of the Potomac.
General McClellan complied with the order.</p>

<p>The First Corps was composed of Franklin's,
McCall's, and King's Divisions, and was commanded
by Major-General McDowell.</p>

<p>The Second Corps was composed of Richardson's,
Blenker's, and Sedgwick's Divisions, and
was commanded by Major-General Sumner.</p>

<p>The Third Corps was commanded by Major-General
Heintzelman, and was composed of Fitz-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>John
Porter's, Hooker's, and Hamilton's Divisions.</p>

<p>The Fourth Corps was commanded by Major-General
Keyes, and was composed of Couch's,
Smith's, and Casey's Divisions.</p>

<p>The Fifth Corps was composed of Shields's and
Williams's Divisions, and was commanded by
Major-General Banks.</p>

<p>It was a long, dull winter to the soldiers. They
waited impatiently for action. Camp-life was
not all song-singing and dancing. There were
days and weeks of stormy weather, when there
could be no drills. The mud was deep, and the
soldiers had little to do but doze by the camp-fires
through the long winter days and nights.
Thousands who had led correct lives at home fell
into habits of dissipation and vice. Their wives
and children haunted their dreams at night. A
sorrow settled upon them,&mdash;a longing for home,
which became a disease, and sent thousands to
the hospital, and finally to the grave. The army
early in the winter began to suffer for want of
something to do.</p>

<p>Some of the colonels and chaplains saw that
it was of the utmost importance that something
should be done to take up the minds of the men
and turn their thoughts from the scenes of home.
Lyceums, debating-societies, schools, in which
Latin, German, arithmetic, reading, and writing
were taught, were established. The chaplains,&mdash;those
who were true, earnest men, established
Sunday schools, and organized churches, and
held prayer-meetings. God blessed their efforts,
and hundreds of soldiers became sincere Christians,
attesting their faith in Jesus Christ as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
the Saviour of men by living correct lives and
breaking off their evil habits. Under the influence
of the religious teachings there was a great
reform in the army. The men became sober.
They no longer gambled away their money. They
became quiet and orderly, obeyed the commands
of their officers in doing unpleasant duties with
alacrity. Some who had been drunkards for
years signed the temperance pledge. They became
cheerful. They took new views of their
duties and obligations to their country and their
God, and looked through the gloom and darkness
to the better life beyond the grave. Several of
the chaplains organized churches. One noble
chaplain says of the church in his regiment:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I received into its communion one hundred
and seventy members, about sixty of whom for
the first time confessed Christ. At the commencement
of the services I baptized six young
soldiers. They kneeled before me, and I consecrated
them to God for life and for death,&mdash;the
majority of them baptized, as it proved, for
death. I then read the form of covenant, the
system of faith, to which all gave their assent. I
then read the names of those who wished to enter
this fold in the Wilderness; those who had made
a profession of religion at home, and came to us
as members of Christian churches, and those who
now came as disciples of the Redeemer.</p>

<p>"Then followed the communion service. This
was one of the most affecting and impressive
seasons of my life. The powers of the world to
come rested on all minds. The shadow of the
great events so soon to follow was creeping over
us, giving earnestness and impressive solemnity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
to all hearts. It was a day never to be forgotten
as a commencement of a new era in the life of
many. It was a scene on which angels might look
down with unmingled pleasure, for here the weary
found rest, the burdened the peace of forgiveness,
the broken in heart, beauty for ashes.</p>

<p><a name="tn_png_49"></a><!--TN: Quote added before "Our" on Page 48-->"Our position increased in a high degree the
interest of the occasion. We were far from our
churches and homes. Yet we found here the
sacred emblems of our religion, and looking into
the future, which we knew was full of danger,
sickness, and death to many, we have girded ourselves
for the conflict. It much resembled the
solemn communion of Christians in the time of
persecution. Our friends who were present from
a distance, of whom there were several, rejoiced
greatly that there was such a scene in the army.
General Jameson was deeply moved and afterwards
said it was the most solemn and interesting
scene of his life.</p>

<p>"Again, on Sabbath, March 9th, the religious
interest continuing, we held another communion.
At this time twenty-eight were received into the
church. Seven young men were baptized. The
interest was greater than at the former communion,
and it gives me the greatest satisfaction to
know that this season, which gave to many the
highest enjoyment ever known on earth, when the
cup of thanksgiving was mingled with tears of
gratitude, prepared for the sacrifice that was to
follow. Many who were there never again partook
of the wine of promise until they drank it
new in the kingdom of God, and sat down at the
marriage supper of the Lamb."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<h3>THE SIEGE OF YORKTOWN.</h3>


<p><span class="firstwords">The</span> Rebel army suddenly evacuated Centreville,
Manassas, and the line of the Potomac,
carrying off everything of value. The Army of
the Potomac moved on the 9th of March to Manassas,
beheld the deserted encampments, returned
to Alexandria, and sailed for Fortress Monroe.
General McClellan decided to advance upon
Richmond by the Peninsula, between the York
and James Rivers. General McDowell, with McCall's
and King's divisions, was stationed at
Fredericksburg, to cover Washington. Blenker's
division was detached from Sumner's Corps, and
sent to the Shenandoah Valley. All the other
divisions sailed down the Chesapeake. The troops
landed at Newport News and went into camp.</p>

<p>The Rebel General Magruder occupied Yorktown.
He was fortifying it and the Peninsula,
erecting batteries to command York River, and
to cover the approaches by land. The iron-clad
Merrimack, with the Teazer and Jamestown gunboats,
were in the James River. Admiral Goldsborough,
with the Monitor, the Minnesota, and
several gunboats, was watching them, and guarding
the shipping at Fortress Monroe.</p>

<p>General McClellan submitted his plans to the
President. He had two methods of operation in
view;&mdash;one, to attack Magruder's works, between
the York and the James, which might require<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
siege operations, and a delay of many weeks; the
other, to obtain aid from the navy, attack the
water-batteries at Yorktown, silence them, and
then go up the York River with his army, sailing
to West Point, within twenty-five miles of Richmond.
Admiral Goldsborough could not spare
gunboats enough to attack the batteries, and
therefore General McClellan adopted the other
plan.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>On the evening of April 3d the army received
orders to march the next morning.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful night. The sky was cloudless.
A new moon shed its silver light upon the
vast encampment. The soldiers had been waiting
two weeks. They were one hundred thousand
strong, while the Rebel force did not number
more than ten or twelve thousand.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>They expected to move to victory. They sang
songs, wrote letters to their friends, burnished
their guns, heaped the fires with fresh fuel, and
rejoiced that after so many months of waiting
they were to be active.</p>

<p>There were some who had a true appreciation
of the work before them, and realized that they
might fall in the hour of battle.</p>

<p>One who had fought at Bull Run, whose heart
was in the great cause, prepared his last will and
testament. At the close of it he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>"And now, having arranged for the disposition
of my worldly estate, I will say that, possessing
a full confidence in the Christian religion,
and believing in the righteousness of the cause
in which I am engaged, I am ready to offer my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
poor life in vindication of that cause, and in sustaining
a government the mildest and most beneficent
the world has ever known."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>At three o'clock in the morning the soldiers
were astir, roused by the drum-beat and the
bugle. The fading fires were rekindled. Their
coffee was soon bubbling on the coals. Before
daylight they had their knapsacks packed, their
tents taken down, and all things ready for the
march. By sunrise they were on the road, General
Heintzelman's corps leading the column.
The roads were deep with mud, and the marching
was heavy, but so enthusiastic were the soldiers
that by ten o'clock the head of the column
encountered the enemy's pickets in front of Yorktown.</p>

<p>Both armies were upon historic ground. It
was at Yorktown that the British army under
Lord Cornwallis laid down its arms in 1781. It
was a flourishing village then. There were fine
mansions, surrounded with shrubbery, shaded by
old oaks and lindens. Virginia in those days
had many wealthy families. The Peninsula was
the first settled territory in America, and many
of the planters had immense estates. One of the
signers of the Declaration of Independence resided
at Yorktown,&mdash;Governor Nelson. His house
is yet standing,&mdash;a large two-story brick building,
which General Magruder occupied for his
head-quarters. It bears the marks of shot which
were fired by the Americans during the siege in
1781. Governor Nelson commanded the Virginia
militia then. He was a noble patriot, and aimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
the cannon himself at his own house to drive out
the British who had possession of it.</p>

<p>Cornwallis had a line of earthworks around
Yorktown, and those which Magruder erected
were on pretty much the same line, only Magruder's,
besides encircling the town, also reached
across the Peninsula. The English general had
between seven and eight thousand men. General
Washington and Count Rochambeau had about
fifteen thousand. They were large armies for
those days, but very small when compared with
that commanded by General McClellan.</p>

<p>It was a long march which the French and
American troops made to reach Yorktown. They
marched from New York, in July, through Philadelphia,
Baltimore, Annapolis, Mount Vernon,
and Williamsburg. They had no transports to
take them down the Chesapeake, besides, there
was an English fleet in the bay which might have
captured the entire army had it moved by water.</p>

<p>In the American army were officers whose
names are inseparably connected with the history
of our country,&mdash;General Knox, Baron Steuben,
Lafayette, General Clinton, General Lincoln,
Colonel Scammell, the brave New Hampshire
officer who was shot by a Hessian soldier. In the
French army were Count Rochambeau, Marquis
St. Simon, and Baron Viomeil. In the bay floated
the English ships of war, and outside, near Cape
Henry, was the Count de Grasse, with his formidable
fleet.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, the 13th of October, the
place was completely invested. The Americans
of the allied army moved down the road leading
to Hampton, and swung round by Wormley Creek.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
General Lincoln commanded the right wing, and
had his head-quarters near the creek. Lafayette,
with his light infantry, and Governor Nelson,
with the Virginia militia, were on the north side
of the Hampton road, while south of it were the
New England and New Jersey and New York
troops, under General Clinton. They held the
center of the American line. The left wing of the
Americans, on Warwick River, was composed of
Maryland and Pennsylvania troops, under Baron
Steuben. On the west side of the Warwick were
Washington's and Rochambeau's head-quarters,
on the south side of the road. The French troops
held the ground from this point to York River
west of the town.</p>

<p>Lord Cornwallis capitulated on the 16th of
October. On the 17th his fine army marched
out from the town along the Hampton road about
a mile to a field, where the soldiers laid down
their arms. The American army was drawn up
on the north side of the road and the French on
the south side,&mdash;two long lines of troops. The
British army marched between them, the drums
beating a slow march, and the colors which had
waved proudly on so many battle-fields closely
encased. It was a sorrowful march to the British
soldiers. Some of them cried with vexation, and
drew their caps over their faces to hide their
tears. Lord Cornwallis felt the humiliation so
deeply that he delegated General O'Hara to surrender
up his sword.</p>

<p>It was an imposing scene. Washington and all
the generals of the army, with their suits, in rich
uniforms and on fine horses, the long lines of
soldiers, the colors waving in the breeze, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
British army in its scarlet uniforms, the crowd of
spectators from the country who had heard of
the news, and had hastened to see the surrender,
made it one of the grandest sights ever seen in
America.</p>

<p>On such ground, hallowed by noble deeds, the
troops of the Union, as their fathers had done
before them, were to carry on the siege of Yorktown.</p>

<p>The Rebels also undoubtedly felt the influence
of those stirring times of the Revolution. They
believed that they were fighting for their liberty,
and were engaged in a just war. But sincerity
is not certain proof of the righteousness of a
cause. Chaplain Davis, of the Fourth Texas regiment,
has this vindication of the rebellion, written
by the camp-fires at Yorktown:&mdash;</p>

<p>"How many pleasing recollections crowd upon
the mind of each soldier as he walks over these
grounds, or sitting thoughtfully by his fagots,
recalls the history of the past, and compares it
with the scenes of the present. The patriots of
the Revolution were struggling for liberty, and
so are we. They had been oppressed with burdensome
taxation,&mdash;so were we. They remonstrated,&mdash;so
did we. They submitted till submission
ceased to be a virtue,&mdash;and so have we. They
appealed to Parliament, but were unheard. Our
Representatives in Congress pointed to the maelstrom
to which they were driving the ship, but
they refused to see it. Our fathers asked for
equalities of rights and privileges, but it was
refused. The South asked that their claim to
territory won by the common blood and treasure
of the country be recognized, and that our domes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>tic
institutions, as guaranteed by the Constitution,
be respected. These petitions were answered
by professed ministers of the Church of
Jesus Christ in raising contributions from the
sacred pulpit on the holy Sabbath of Sharpe's
Rifles, to shed Southern blood on common territory.
Their Representatives declared, upon the
floors of Congress, that they were in favor of 'An
Antislavery Constitution, an Antislavery Bible,
and an Antislavery God!' What is now left us?
Naught but the refuge our fathers had,&mdash;the God
of Justice and the God of Battles. To him have
we appealed, and by his aid and our good right
arms we will pass through the ordeal of blood
and come out conquerors in the end."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>Many thousands of the Union soldiers were
thinking, reflecting men. There were ministers,
professors in colleges, school-teachers, and learned
and scientific men. Few there were who could
not read and write. Thousands of them had been
teachers and scholars in the Sunday schools.
They had thought the war all over, and discussed
the causes which led to it. They were familiar
with the history of events,&mdash;of the struggle between
Slavery and Freedom; for the possession
of Kansas, where men and women were driven
out, their buildings burned, or themselves thrown
into rivers, or deliberately murdered, for preferring
freedom to slavery. They recalled the
attempt to compel the people of the North to return
the slaves who were escaping to Canada,&mdash;also
the kidnapping of free citizens of the North;
the imprisonment of men and women for teach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>ing
a slave to read the Bible. They remembered
that a Northern man could not travel with safety
in the South before the war, that Slavery was
opposed always to Freedom, that the system
crushed the poor laboring men without distinction
of color, race, or clime or country; that it
was overbearing, imperious, aristocratic, arrogant,
and cruel; that it kept the people from
obtaining knowledge; that it was the foe of industry,
the enemy of science, art, and religion.</p>

<p>They remembered the words of Mr. Stephens,
of Georgia, the Vice-President of the Confederacy,
who in the beginning opposed secession; who said
to his associates in the convention which carried
his State out of the Union:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is the best and freest government, the most
equal in its rights, the most just in its decisions,
the most lenient in its measures, and the most
inspiring in its principles to elevate the race of
man that the sun of heaven ever shone upon.
Now for you to attempt to overthrow such a
government as this, unassailed, is the height of
madness, folly, and wickedness."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>They remembered that Mr. Stephens asked
those who were plotting treason these questions:
"What reasons can you give to the nations of the
earth to justify it? They will be calm and deliberate
judges in the case; and to what law, to
what one overt act, can you point on which to
rest the plea of justification? What right has
the North assailed? What interest of the South
has been invaded? What justice has been denied,
or what claim founded in justice and right has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
been withheld? Can any of you name one governmental
act of wrong deliberately and purposely
done by the government at Washington of
which the South had a right to complain? I
challenge the answer."</p>

<p>They remembered that the Secretary of War
under President Buchanan, Mr. Floyd of Virginia,
had removed all the arms from the Northern
arsenals to the South, that the slaveholders
might be well prepared for war, and ready to seize
the city of Washington.</p>

<p>They remembered that Mr. Toucey of Connecticut,
who was President Buchanan's Secretary
of the Navy, had sent nearly all the ships of war
into foreign seas, that they might not be at
hand in the hour of rebellion, when the government
should pass into new hands, and that the
Secretary of the Treasury stole millions of dollars
of public funds intrusted to his care.
They reflected that all of these men had forsworn
themselves, that they were traitors and robbers,
that they had deliberately, through years of
power, planned to rebel, to destroy the government,
and bring ruin upon the people if they
could not have their way. They believed that
without cause the Rebels had fired upon the flag,
and inaugurated the war, and that to defend the
flag and restore the Union, by crushing out the
rebellion, was a duty they owed to their country
and to God. They recalled the words of Thomas
Jefferson, uttered long ago, in his notes on Virginia,
who said, in view of the complicity of the
South with slavery:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I tremble for my country when I reflect that
God is just, and that his justice cannot sleep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
forever. The Almighty has no attribute that
can take side with us in such a contest."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>Those thinking men remembered the words of
the great man who wrote the Declaration of Independence,
and they also remembered that the
oppressed and down-trodden of all lands were
looking to America,&mdash;to the principles of the
government of the United States,&mdash;as their hope
for the future. They did not forget their homes
on the breezy hills of the North and in the sunny
valleys, nor the church-bell, nor the school-house,
and other things dearer to them than life.
They must fight to maintain them. Their liberties
were assailed. They could not falter in such
a contest.</p>

<p>So they reflected as they sat by their camp-fires
in the starry night, or lay upon the ground
where their fathers achieved the last great victory
which secured their independence.</p>

<p>The corps commanded by General Heintzelman,
when it came into position before Yorktown,
stood upon the ground which General Lincoln
had occupied in the siege of 1781. General Sumner's
corps had the center, and occupied the
ground which Baron Steuben and General Clinton
held in that siege. General Keyes's corps
came to the Warwick River, at Lee's Mills, almost
opposite the spot where General Washington had
his head-quarters, while General Franklin was
held in reserve to move up York River on transports
when the enemy was driven from Yorktown.</p>

<p>General Heintzelman arrived in front of the
works, and was greeted with shells from Magru<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>der's
batteries. While the cannon were booming
on that afternoon of the 4th, the following
brief telegram was sent over the wires from Washington
to Fortress Monroe:&mdash;</p>

<p>"By direction of the President, General McDowell's
army corps has been detached from the
force under your immediate command, and the
General is ordered to report to the Secretary of
War."</p>

<p>General McClellan received it on the 5th. He
remarks:&mdash;</p>

<p>"To me the blow was most discouraging. It
frustrated all my plans for impending operations.
It fell when I was too deeply committed to withdraw.
It left me incapable of continuing operations
which had been begun. It compelled the
adoption of another, a different, and a less effective
plan of campaign. It made rapid and brilliant
operations impossible. It was a fatal error.
It was now of course out of my power to turn
Yorktown by West Point. I had therefore no
choice left but to attack it directly in front as
I best could with the force at my command."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p>This brief despatch will demand the patient
consideration of historians in the future, who,
when the passions and prejudices of men have
passed away, calmly and dispassionately review
the causes of the failure of the Peninsular campaign.
On one hand, it is alleged to have been
the fatal error; that it was an unwarrantable interference,
which made it impossible for General
McClellan to conduct the campaign to a successful
issue.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is asked how the presence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
of McDowell would have enabled him to go to
West Point without the aid of the navy, which
he could not have.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>How did it compel the adoption of another
plan, inasmuch as the order for the troops to
advance and attack the works at Yorktown was
issued on the 3d, and they marched on the 4th,
and were engaged with the enemy before General
McClellan received the orders? It is claimed,
therefore, that the issuing of the order was not a
fatal error; that it did not compel the adoption
of another plan; that no other plan was adopted;
that it did not leave General McClellan incapable
of continuing operations already begun; that it
did not deprive him of the power of taking West
Point, inasmuch as he never had had the power;
neither did it compel an attack directly in front,
for that had already begun; and that the President
in making the change was only enforcing
the conditions on which he accepted the plan of
a movement to the Peninsula,&mdash;the retention of a
force sufficient to cover Washington,&mdash;which General
McClellan had not complied with.</p>

<p>In the correspondence which passed between
the President and General McClellan, the President
has this explanation and vindication of his
course:&mdash;</p>

<p>"My explicit directions that Washington
should, by the judgment of all commanders of
corps, be left entirely secure, had been entirely
neglected. It was precisely this that drove me
to detain McDowell. I do not forget that I was
satisfied with your arrangement to leave Banks
at Manassas Junction, but when that arrange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>ment
was broken up, and nothing was substituted
for it, of course I was not satisfied. I was
constrained to substitute something for it.</p>

<p>"And now allow me to ask you: Do you really
think I should permit the line from Richmond
<i>via</i> Manassas Junction to this city to be entirely
open, except what resistance could be presented
by less than twenty thousand unorganized troops?
This is a question which the country will not
allow me to evade."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>It will be interesting to see how the situation
was viewed by the commanders of the two armies
on the Peninsula. General McClellan's troops
in front of the enemy, present and fit for duty,
numbered one hundred thousand strong.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> He
asked for reinforcements. He wrote thus to the
Secretary of War:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It seems clear that I shall have the whole
force of the enemy on my hands, probably not
less than one hundred thousand men, and probably
more. In consequence of the loss of Blenker's
division and the First Corps (McDowell's),
my force is possibly less than that of the enemy,
while they have the advantage of position."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>"I was compelled," says General Magruder,
"to place in Gloucester Point, Yorktown, and
Mulberry Island, fixed garrisons, amounting to
six thousand men, my whole force being eleven
thousand; so that it will be seen that the balance
of the line, embracing a length of thirteen miles,
was defended by about five thousand men. On
the 5th of April the enemy's columns appeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
along the whole front of my line. I have no
accurate data upon which to base an exact statement
of his force; but, from various sources of
information, I was satisfied that I had before me
the enemy's Army of the Potomac, with the exception
of the two <i>corps d'armée</i> of Banks and
McDowell, forming an aggregate number certainly
of not less than one hundred thousand,
since ascertained to have been one hundred and
twenty thousand.... Thus with five thousand
men, exclusive of the garrisons, we stopped
and held in check over one hundred thousand of
the enemy. Every preparation was made in
anticipation of another attack. The men slept
in the trenches and under arms, but to my utter
surprise he permitted day after day to elapse
without an assault."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>Siege operations commenced,&mdash;spades, picks,
and shovels were given to the troops, and they
began to throw up the breastworks. It was a
slow, tedious, laborious undertaking. The mud
was very deep, the ground soft, and it rained
nearly every day. The woods were very dense.
There were new roads made. The brooks were
bridged. Some of the soldiers made gabions, or
baskets of wicker-work, for the batteries. The
teams floundered through the mud axle-deep.
Thousands of horses gave out from sheer exhaustion.
When the breastworks were ready, the
heavy guns, their carriages, and the ammunition
had to be hauled.</p>

<p>It was almost impossible to accomplish the
work. The horses could not do it, and regiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
of men were detailed to drag the cannon through
the mud.</p>

<p>The soldiers worked faithfully and enthusiastically
day and night, through drenching rains,
lying down to sleep in their wet garments, upon
the water-soaked ground. Fever made its appearance,
and thousands were sent to the hospitals,
worn down by their hard labor and exposure.
The bullets of the enemy killed very few
of those noble men, but thousands sickened and
died.</p>

<p>While the batteries were getting ready, there
was a spirited affair at Lee's Mills on the 16th
of April. General McClellan decided to make a
reconnaissance at that point, and, if everything
was favorable, to throw a portion of his force
across the Warwick River, and gain a foothold
upon the western shore. There was an old field
on the east side of the stream, which was overgrown
with young pines and oaks. A line of
skirmishers, under cover of a heavy artillery fire,
crept down through the pines to the edge of the
stream. The Rebel battery upon the other side
answered the Union artillery with solid shot and
shells.</p>

<p>Colonel Hyde of the Third Vermont was ordered
to cover the stream with two companies.
The crossing was just below the dam, over which
the water poured in a silver sheet. The creek
was swollen with rains, but the sons of Vermont
were not the men to falter. They plunged in up
to their necks. Their ammunition was soaked,
but they pushed on up the other bank, with a
cheer. They were met by the Fifteenth North
Carolina. They did not stop an instant, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
rushed upon the Carolinians, who fled to the
rear in great confusion, and the Vermonters took
possession of their rifle-pits. The commander of
the Carolinians, Colonel McVining, fell mortally
wounded, also many of his men, before the impetuous
charge of the Green Mountaineers. But
Rebel reinforcements were at hand. Anderson's
brigade advanced, and the handful of men was
obliged to recross the stream. The golden moment
for throwing a division across and breaking
the enemy's line was lost. Later in the day a
second attempt was made by the Fourth and Fifth
Vermont regiments to cross upon the dam, but
the Rebel batteries swept it, and the attempt was
not successful. The losses during the day were
about one hundred on each side.</p>

<p>The month of April passed before the first
siege guns were ready to open fire. Meanwhile
Magruder was reinforced. On the first day of
May a heavy battery near York River began to
throw shells and solid shot into Yorktown. That
night negroes came into General McClellan's lines
and reported that the Rebels were leaving Yorktown,
but their story was not believed by the
General. Preparations were made to open a fire
from all the guns and mortars on the 4th of May.</p>

<p>General Magruder kept close watch of the operations,
and when General McClellan was ready,
quietly retreated towards Williamsburg. He ordered
his artillerymen to keep up a heavy fire
through the night, to spike the guns just before
daybreak, and leave the place. So through the
night there was a grand uproar of artillery along
the Rebel lines. The gunners seemed to vie with
each other to see which could fire most rapidly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
and throw away the most shot and shells. They
took no aim, but fired at random towards the
Union lines.</p>

<p>At daybreak it was discovered that there was
no sign of life or motion in the Rebel camp.
The guns still looked frowningly from the fortifications,
tents were standing; but the troops were
all gone, and Yorktown was deserted.</p>

<p>They carried off all their light artillery, nearly
all their provisions and supplies, but left fifty-two
heavy guns in the intrenchments. They planted
torpedoes, and connected them with wires and
cords. A Union soldier hit his foot against a
wire and an explosion followed, which blew off
his legs.</p>

<p>General Magruder, by showing a bold front,
with eleven thousand men at first, had held an
army of a hundred thousand in check, and gained
a month of valuable time for preparations for the
defense of Richmond.</p>

<h3>BATTLE OF WILLIAMSBURG.</h3>


<p><span class="firstwords">The</span> first battle in the Peninsular campaign of
the Army of the Potomac was fought at Williamsburg,
one of the oldest towns in Virginia. It was
settled in 1632, and was capital of the Colony for
many years before the Revolution. William and
Mary's College is there, which was endowed by
the king and queen of England with twenty thousand
acres of land, and a penny on every pound
of tobacco sent out of the Colony, and duties on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
all the furs and skins. The college buildings
were designed by Sir Christopher Wren, architect
of St. Paul's in London.</p>

<p>The colonial governors resided at Williamsburg.
The courts were held there. The government
buildings were the noblest in America. The
Governor's residence was a <a name="tn_png_67"></a><!--TN: "magnificient" changed to "magnificent" on Page 66-->magnificent edifice,
with a great estate of three hundred acres attached,
laid out in lawns, parks, groves, flower-gardens,
and peach-orchards. It was intersected
by a brook. There were winding graveled walks,
shaded by oaks and lindens.</p>

<p>On public occasions, and on birth-nights, there
were grand receptions at the palace, as it was
called, where all the public officers and gentlemen
assembled to pay their respects to the governor.
The judges and counselors, in flowing robes and
powdered wigs, the gentlemen of the Colony in
broidered waistcoats, ruffled shirts, buff breeches,
black stockings, and red, yellow, green, blue, or
purple coats, with gold and silver shoe-buckles,
and ladies in silks and satins, rode up in their
carriages, driven by coachmen, and attended by
footmen in livery.</p>

<p>During the sessions of the House of Burgesses
there were gay times. The town was filled with
visitors. The wealth, fashion, and refinement of
the Colony gathered there. It was there in the
House of Burgesses that Patrick Henry uttered
the patriotic sentiment,&mdash;"Give me liberty, or
give me death." It was from Williamsburg that
Sir William Berkeley wrote to the King's commissioners,
thanking God that there were no common
schools or printing-presses in Virginia. Washington,
when but twenty-one years of age,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
mounted his horse at the palace-gate, for his long
journey to the head-waters of the Ohio, chosen by
Governor Dinwiddie, out of all the aristocratic
families of the Colony, to bear a message to the
French commander in that far-off region; and
there, at the same gate, he dismounted from his
horse on the 22d of January, 1754, having faithfully
accomplished what he had undertaken.</p>

<p>East of this old town, a small stream, which
rises in the center of the Peninsula, runs southeast
and empties into College Creek. Very near
the head-waters of this stream another has its
rise, which runs north to the York River, and is
called Queen's Creek. On both streams there are
mills. The main road from Yorktown to Williamsburg
runs on the high land between the
head-waters of the creeks. About a mile east
of the town the road forks. General Magruder
had thrown up a strong fortification at that point,
which contained thirteen guns, and was called
Fort Magruder. There were ten other earthworks
which effectually commanded the roads,
the ravines, and all the approaches from the east.</p>

<p>In pursuing Magruder, General Stoneman,
with the cavalry and Gibson's battery, went up
the Yorktown road, and came out of the dense
forest in front of Fort Magruder. The guns
opened fire, throwing shells, which killed and
wounded several of the cavalrymen. Gibson
brought his battery into position and replied.
The Sixth United States Cavalry moved on towards
the fort, but were met by infantry and cavalry,
and were compelled to fall back with the
loss of thirty men. Gibson was obliged to move
his guns, for the batteries in the fort had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
range of his position. The mud was deep, and
one of the guns sunk to the axle. The horses
tugged and pulled, but they also sunk. Other
horses were added, but the ground was marshy,
and gun and horses went still deeper.</p>

<p>The Rebel gunners saw the confusion, and
threw their shells upon the spot. Some burst
harmlessly in the air, some fell into the mud,
others tore up the ground and covered the artillerymen
and teamsters with earth, others burst
among the horses and men. The Rebel infantry
came down upon the run, and Captain Gibson
was obliged to leave.</p>

<p>The night came on dark and dismal. The rain
fell in torrents. The troops who had been marching
all day were drenched. The roads were narrow
and muddy. There was a want of arrangement
in the order of marching, and the divisions
became confused. Wagons broke down, artillery
sunk in the mire; but the troops were eager to
get at the enemy, who had eluded their commander,
first at Manassas, and now at Yorktown.
They marched, some of them, till midnight, and
then, without kindling a fire, lay down drenched,
upon the dead forest leaves, having had no dinner,
and without a supper. The rain-drops dripped
from the trees through the night, but the soldiers
were in line at daybreak, ready to move
again in pursuit of the enemy.</p>

<p>General Hooker being in advance upon the
Lee's Mills road, came upon the enemy's pickets
posted along a deep ravine above the mill-pond,
on the stream which empties into College Creek.</p>

<p>General Smith's division, when the army advanced
from Yorktown, was on the Lee's Mills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
road, but it moved towards the north and came
in front of the enemy on the Yorktown road.</p>

<p>General Hooker's skirmishers, as soon as they
saw the enemy, dashed on and drove them across
the ravine, and approached within musket-shot
of the fort. The artillery in the fort opened with
a rapid fire of shells, but the skirmishers concealed
themselves in the underbrush, and gave so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
deadly a fire that they silenced the guns. No
gunner could show his head without getting a
ball through it.</p>

<p>General Hooker formed his division in line of
battle. His first brigade was commanded by
General Sickles, and was composed of the First,
Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Excelsior regiments
from New York. His second brigade, General
Grover's, was composed of the First and
Eleventh Massachusetts, Second New Hampshire,
and Twenty-sixth Pennsylvania. The third brigade
was composed of the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh,
and Eighth New Jersey regiments, and was commanded
by Colonel Starr,&mdash;in all, about eight
thousand men.</p>

<p>The First Massachusetts had the left of the
line, then the Second New Hampshire, Eleventh
Massachusetts, with the Twenty-sixth Pennsylvania
on the right. The other brigades did not
arrive till nearly noon. They formed on the
left of Grover's brigade, towards the mill-pond.</p>

<p>The Rebel force in position behind the forts is
supposed to have been about thirty thousand,
commanded by General Longstreet. A Rebel
officer states that it numbered not over twenty-five
thousand.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>During the forenoon but a small force confronted
General Grover's brigade, but in the
afternoon dark columns appeared south of the
fort, and, advancing down the ravines, crossed the
stream above the mill-pond.</p>

<p>They attacked General Hooker's left wing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
great force. The skirmishers were driven in.
Bramhall's battery came into position as the
enemy advanced. "Shell with short fuses!"
shouted the captain to his gunners.</p>

<p>The shells exploded in, around, and above the
advancing columns, which still kept coming on.
The musketry began,&mdash;quick and sharp volleys;
yet the lines came on, across the open space,
through the woods.</p>

<p>"Canister and spherical case!" was the order
to the gunners. The cannon spouted a deadly
fire, filling the air with terrible hail. The Rebel
lines were checked. Foiled in the attack upon the
center, they advanced once more upon the left
flank, and the contest went on with increasing
fury, like the rising of a winter tempest.</p>

<p>Grover and Sickles held their ground tenaciously,
but were forced back inch by inch and
step by step.</p>

<p>The contest was in the edge of the forest, over
fallen trees, where men fell headlong in their
endeavors to take new positions. The rain was
falling, the ground was miry. The men were
worn and weary; but they fought on, minding
not hunger or thirst or exhaustion, calling for
ammunition. Their cartridge-boxes were empty,
but they would not turn their backs upon the
enemy, or desert their comrades whose cartridges
still held out.</p>

<p>From noon till four o'clock General Hooker
fought unaided. He sent to Sumner for reinforcements,
but Sumner felt that he could not
spare any men from his front. He sent officers
to bring up the brigades in the rear.</p>

<p>General McClellan was at Yorktown, and did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
not know there was a battle going on till late in
the day.</p>

<p>The Rebels saw that Hooker received no reinforcements,
and pressed him heavily. His troops
supporting some of the batteries gave way. The
Rebels came on in a desperate charge, shot
the horses, and five cannon fell into their
hands.</p>

<p>"Reinforcements! I want reinforcements!"
was Hooker's cry. The impetuous Kearney,
whose division was the last to leave Yorktown,
had heard the roar of battle, and rode ahead of
his troops. He was an old soldier, had stormed
the heights of Chapultepec, and was with Louis
Napoleon in the great battle of Solferino. He
started back to hasten forward his division, but
it was already advancing.</p>

<p>The brave, energetic, resolute Berry, who commanded
one of Kearney's brigades, met an aide
of General Sumner's.</p>

<p>"Who is engaged at the front?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Hooker is at it."</p>

<p>"Is he supported by Sumner?"</p>

<p>"No. Sumner is taking position farther to the
right."</p>

<p>The road was filled with teams and troops of
other brigades belonging to Sumner's corps.
Berry looked at the blockade a moment, then said
to a captain of one of his batteries,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Captain, go ahead and clear the road for my
brigade."</p>

<p>"Let the march be upon the double-quick," was
the order sent down the line.</p>

<p>"Clear the road!" was the authoritative order
sent up the line. The troops, the wagons, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
artillery, the ambulances, turned aside, and the
brigade went on.</p>

<p>His quick ear caught the sound of musketry,&mdash;a
constant, steady rattle, like the pattering of
the rain-drops on the dead leaves.</p>

<p>"Throw aside your knapsacks, and place a
guard over them," was his order. The men,
panting for breath, came to a halt, threw their
heavy knapsacks into a heap, and went on again,
faster than before.</p>

<p>Kearney met them. "You have done well,
General," was his salutation to Berry. He stimulated
the men, and fired their ardor with his own
wild enthusiasm. They rushed on through by-paths,
across pastures and fields.</p>

<p>Hooker's line was giving way. It had been
pushed back a mile, had lost a portion of its
guns, and the exultant enemy were advancing for
a decisive, a finishing stroke. Many had fired
their last round of ammunition, and stood with
empty muskets. How earnestly they looked towards
the rear to see if the promised aid was ever
to arrive!</p>

<p>Help at last. A dark column comes through
the woods upon the run. A wild, tumultuous
cheer rends the air. The men who are ready to
drop from sheer exhaustion, who have confronted
the enemy through the lagging hours, feel new
strength as Berry sweeps past them, deploys his
line right and left, and becomes a living barrier
between them and the tide already rolling on
over the bloody field. The enemy advances, but
whole ranks go down before the deadly volleys
given point-blank into their faces by that body of
men whose brows are wet with the sweat of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
fast running. The breaker is broken. The wave
which was ready to sweep Hooker from the face
of the earth, instead of setting onward, begins to
recede. It is beaten down before the fiery breath
pouring like a furnace blast from the three thousand
muskets.</p>

<p>The Rebels retreat. Berry advances. His
volleys are steady and regular. Nothing can
daunt his men. They feel that they are a power.
Kearney sees that the time has come to decide
the day.</p>

<p>"Give them the bayonet!" is the thrilling order
which rings along the line.</p>

<p>An officer, young in years, fair of countenance,
polished in manner, who has traveled at home and
abroad, the same who in the silent hours of the
last night at Yorktown wrote his last will and
testament, the adjutant of General Berry, leads
the men from Michigan. His voice rings loud
and clear above the wild uproar. The men follow
where he leads, into the leaden rain. They
fall by scores, but on&mdash;on&mdash;on,&mdash;over the bloody
field,&mdash;over fallen friends and foes,&mdash;they press
the foe, regaining the ground, the lost cannon,&mdash;the
victory!</p>

<p>"You are the hero of the day," said Kearney
to Captain Smith, who had led the charge so gallantly,
as he returned and reported for further
duty, his clothes torn by the bullets of the enemy.</p>

<p>While this was transpiring on the left,
there was its counterpart on the right.</p>

<p>General Hancock was detached by General
Smith to cross the milldam at Queen's Creek,
and attack the Rebels in that direction. He
crossed the stream with the Sixth Maine, Fourth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
Wisconsin, Forty-ninth Pennsylvania, and Forty-third
New York, Wheeler's battery, and a squadron
of cavalry.</p>

<p>He came upon a small party of Rebels, who
rapidly retreated.</p>

<p>"I can go to Fort Magruder if well supported,"
was the despatch he sent back to General Smith.</p>

<p>He could see the fort across the open plain,
smoking and flaming and throwing shells upon
Hooker's command. General Smith sent the message
to General Sumner, requesting permission
to send supports.</p>

<p>"Stay where you are," was the reply.</p>

<p>Again Hancock sent for permission to go on.
Smith sent the request to Sumner.</p>

<p>"Go," was the welcome answer.</p>

<p>The troops were on the march, when an aide
from Sumner stopped the movement. The Rebels
were threatening an attack on the center.</p>

<p>"I want more force to support us. The enemy
is coming in superior force to attack me," was
Hancock's third message.</p>

<p>His position was in a field near a farm-house,
where the Rebels had thrown up a square redoubt,
which they had abandoned.</p>

<p>From the farm-house to the woods west of it
there was a rail-fence. Hancock threw out his
skirmishers towards Fort Magruder, beyond the
farm-house. Wheeler's battery was brought up
and placed upon a knoll near the house. The
Fifth Wisconsin and Forty-Third New York were
stationed west of the house behind the fence.
The Forty-ninth Pennsylvania was placed behind
the house. Two companies of the Sixth Maine
held the abandoned redoubt, while the other com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>panies
of that regiment were placed in support of the
battery.</p>

<p>Two brigades of Rebels marched out from the
forest into the field. Wheeler's battery opened
with shells. The Rebels were half a mile distant,
but, notwithstanding the fire, they moved steadily
and rapidly over the intervening space. The
skirmishers which had been thrown out from
Hancock returned to the lines. The Rebels were
near enough for canister, and the six pieces of
cannon threw it into the advancing line. The
Rebel cavalry dashed upon the Fifth Wisconsin,
but only to lose a dozen men and horses. The
infantry were close upon Wheeler, who covered
the hillock with a murky cloud. Suddenly his
fire ceased, then with whip and spur and shout
the pieces went to the rear and took a new position
and opened again. The regiments by the
fence fell back and closed up in closer order.
The Rebels again advanced, and the musketry
began. The fight was at short range. The battery
fired shell, canister, and shrapnel, and made terrible
havoc.</p>

<p>Hancock saw that the moment for decisive
action had come. He waved his cap to his troops.
The officers along the line understood the meaning
of the signal. They spoke but one magical
word. The men, as if animated by an electric
impulse, moved towards the enemy. Their bayonets
became a gleaming, glittering, bristling,
moving hedge. They broke into a run. Each
man felt the enthusiasm of the moment. They
heeded not the deadly volleys, but went on
through the storm, with a cheer louder than the
roar of the battle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>The Rebels did not wait to receive the blow,
but fled in confusion from the field.</p>

<p>It was a glorious moment. Berry at that instant
was throwing in a living barrier against the
flood which had swept Hooker back. The battle
was won. Night came on. It had rained through
the day, and the men, victorious at last, lay down
to sleep upon the field, while the Rebels fled
towards Richmond, leaving several cannon, many
wagons, and several hundred of their wounded
in Williamsburg.</p>

<p>The total Union loss was two thousand two
hundred and eighty-eight. The loss to the Rebels
was from two thousand five hundred to three
thousand.</p>

<p>"Our loss amounted to about two thousand
five hundred," says the chaplain of the Fourth
Texas.</p>

<p>When the news of the battle reached Richmond
there was great consternation, which was increased
by the news of the blowing up of the
Merrimack on the morning of the 11th of May.</p>

<p>"In the President's mansion about this time
all was consternation and dismay," says Pollard,
the Southern historian.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>Jefferson Davis's niece wrote a letter to a friend
in Vicksburg, but the mail-bag was captured by
the Yankee pickets.</p>

<p>"General Johnston," said the young lady, "is
falling back from the Peninsula, and Uncle Jeff
thinks we had better go to a safer place than
Richmond. O mother! Uncle Jeff is miserable.
He tries to be cheerful and bear up against such
a continuation of troubles, but oh! I fear he can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>not
live long, if he does not get some rest and
quiet.</p>

<p>"Our reverses distressed him so much, and he
is so weak and feeble, it makes my heart ache to
look at him. He knows that he ought to send his
wife and children away, and yet he cannot bear
to part with them, and we all dread to leave
him too. Varina and I had a hard cry about it
to-day.</p>

<p>"O, what a blow the fall of New Orleans was!
It like to have set us all crazy here. Everybody
looks depressed, and the cause of the Confederacy
looks drooping and sinking; but if God is with us,
who can be against us? Our troops are not doing
as well as we expected.... The regiments
most apt to run are from North Carolina and Tennessee....
I am afraid that Richmond will
fall into the hands of the enemy, as there is no
way to keep back the gunboats. James River is
so high that all obstructions are in danger of
being washed away, so that there is no help for
the city....</p>

<p>"Uncle Jeff was confirmed last Tuesday in St.
Paul's Church, by Bishop Johns. He was baptized
at home, in the morning, before church."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>The Confederate Congress adjourned hastily.
They sent off their families. The railroad trains
going out were crowded with passengers. The
public documents were boxed up and sent away.
Mrs. Jefferson Davis took down her window-curtains,
tore up the carpets, packed her silver plate
and pictures, and left the city.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> The Treasury
Department removed its printing-presses to Geor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>gia,
and everybody prepared to leave the city,
which they feared was doomed to fall into the
hands of the Yankees.</p>

<p>When the Merrimack was blown up, the James
River was open to the gunboats to Fort Darling,
within ten miles of Richmond. The fort mounted
four guns. Three of the gunboats bombarded it
on the 13th, but were not able to silence the guns.</p>

<p>General McClellan's transports were at Yorktown
and Fortress Monroe,&mdash;an immense fleet.
His army was within five miles of the James. It
will be for the future historian to inquire whether
the army ought not to have been sent up the James
instead of the Chickahominy.</p>

<p>After the battle of Antietam, a wounded Rebel
officer who was left behind when Lee retreated,
and who was General Magruder's Adjutant-General,
conversed freely upon the Peninsular campaign.</p>

<p>"We were very much surprised at Yorktown,"
he said, "when we saw General McClellan make
preparations for a siege."</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>"Yes, for we were ready to retreat at any moment.
We had only a handful of men compared
with his great army."</p>

<p>"How many men had Magruder at that
time?"</p>

<p>"Not more than nine thousand and five hundred
fit for duty, and they were strung out on
a line thirteen miles long, from Gloucester to
James River. If General McClellan had acted
with vigor, and pushed our center as soon as he
landed, he could have trampled us all down in
the mud."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you had a large number of cannon,
which swept the approaches, and could have inflicted
great damage."</p>

<p>"He could have covered his real attack by
feints on distant parts of the line, and Magruder's
force was so small that he could not have
resisted an earnest attack. The woods were so
dense that McClellan could have effectually concealed
all his movements."</p>

<p>"Some of General McClellan's officers were in
favor of advancing at once."</p>

<p>"It was, in my judgment, if you will allow a
Rebel to criticise your generals," said the officer
with a smile, "his first mistake."</p>

<p>"Then you think it was a mistake on the part
of General McClellan."</p>

<p>"Yes, for Lee's army had not reached us.
Every day's delay on the part of General McClellan
gave us reinforcements. It gave us time
to fortify Richmond. The Confederate army was
much reduced at that time. The term of enlistments
of many regiments had expired, and the
Conscription Act had not been enforced. The
fortunes of the Confederacy at that time were not
very bright, I must confess. Even the Confederate
Congress closed its session and left Richmond,
and, had it not been for McClellan's delay
and the energy with which troops from all quarters
were conscripted and rushed into Richmond,
it would have gone hard with us. And when we
evacuated Yorktown, General McClellan did not
do as I should have done, had I commanded you
Yankees."</p>

<p>"Ah! how so?"</p>

<p>"The Virginia, or the Merrimack, as you call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
her, was blown up on the 10th. It was a bitter
pill to us, and if I were Jefferson Davis I would
hang old Huger, who commanded at Norfolk, for
his cowardly conduct in evacuating the place.
When the Merrimack was destroyed, General McClellan,
instead of following us up the Peninsula
through the mud, ought to have re-embarked his
troops and made all haste up the James. Your
gunboats went up to Fort Darling and got
smashed, but if he had landed below the Fort he
could have carried it from the rear with his infantry,
for we had few troops there. He could
have then brought his gunboats to Richmond
ahead of us who were paddling in the mud of the
Chickahominy."</p>

<p>"I suppose that General McClellan did what
he thought was best at the time."</p>

<p>"Probably; but it happened to be the very best
movement he could have made for us," said the
officer, with a smile.</p>

<p>There was much suffering in the hospitals on
the Peninsula. The medical department was not
well organized, but the delegates of the Christian
and Sanitary Commissions were present, and
saved the lives of many men.</p>

<p>They saw a soldier in a tent one day who was
fast passing away. He had fought his last battle
with the enemy of his country. He was a noble
man, but he was worn out by disease. He had
worked in the slimy swamps, on the fortifications,
and was covered with filth. He had lost all his
strength, and was so weak that he could not raise
his hand to his head. They washed him, changed
his clothing, lifted him from the damp ground
and placed him on a cot, gave him nourishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
food, talked to him of home, of mother, of Jesus,
his best friend, of a better world. The soldier
tried to thank them, but was too weak to articulate
the words. He could only take the chaplain's
hand, press it to his cheek, and bathe it
with tears of gratitude.</p>

<p>Thus the friends at home, by their Christian
sympathy and charity, sustained and comforted
the brave defenders of their country, in their last
hours.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<h3>ON THE CHICKAHOMINY.</h3>


<p><span class="firstwords">On</span> the 16th of May the whole army, with the
exception of Hooker's division, which remained at
Williamsburg, was at the White House on the
Pamunkey, where a permanent depot was established.
The cavalry under General Stoneman,
and the infantry pickets, were on the banks of the
Chickahominy.</p>

<p>General McClellan called for reinforcements.
In response, the President informed him, on the
18th, that General McDowell had been ordered to
march from Fredericksburg to join him by the
shortest route, but was also ordered to keep himself
in position to cover Washington, and General
McClellan was instructed to open communication
with him.</p>

<p>"This order," says General McClellan, "rendered
it impossible for me to use the James River
as a line of operations, and forced me to establish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
our depots on the Pamunkey, and to approach
Richmond from the north. It frustrated the plan
of the campaign."</p>

<p>It will be for the future historian to determine
whether the order to General McDowell to move
overland compelled General McClellan to take the
Chickahominy route, and frustrated the plan of
the campaign, or whether, on the other hand, he
had not chosen the route, by moving from Williamsburg
on the 10th, and establishing his head-quarters
and depots at White House, and throwing
out his cavalry and pickets to Bottom's
Bridge on the Chickahominy on the 16th, two
days before the orders were issued.</p>

<p>The Chickahominy River runs north of Richmond,
flows southeast, and becomes an affluent
of the James above Williamsburg. It is fringed
with forests and bordered by marshy lands, which
at high water become impassable swamps, but at
low water the stream is fordable in many places.
The Rebels destroyed all the bridges as they retreated
to Richmond.</p>

<p>The army came to the river at Bottom's Bridge.
The Eleventh Maine was in the advance. They
were brave, hardy men, from the lumber-swamps
of the Pine-Tree State. The Rebel pickets saw
them, set the bridge on fire, and fled. The Maine
men gave them a volley, rushed forward, used
their caps for fire-buckets, and extinguished the
flames, and with their axes soon had it repaired
for the use of the army.</p>

<p>Heintzelman's and Keyes's corps crossed to the
southern bank, while the other corps pushed up
the northern bank, towards Coal Harbor and
Mechanicsville.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>


<h3><a name="affair"></a>THE AFFAIR AT HANOVER COURT-HOUSE.</h3>

<p>Fourteen miles north of Richmond is Hanover
Court-House. A Rebel force was stationed there,
commanded by General Branch. On the 27th of
May, General Fitz-John Porter, with Emory's
brigade of cavalry, and Martindale's, Butterfield's,
McQuade's, and Warren's brigades of infantry,
proceeded to drive the Rebels from the
place, and make a junction with McDowell. At
noon General Emory, with the cavalry, came upon
the enemy about two miles east of the Court-House,
where the road forks,&mdash;the right hand
road leading to the Court-House, the left hand to
Ashland.</p>

<p>Berdan's sharpshooters and Martindale's brigade
were near by, and General Porter formed in
line of battle. The sharpshooters were thrown
forward as skirmishers. Benson's battery came
into position in a field on the right-hand side of
the road, and commenced throwing shells over the
heads of the sharpshooters.</p>

<p>The Rebels were posted on a hill near a farm-house,&mdash;their
line reaching across both roads.
General Martindale went up the Ashland road,
driving in the skirmishers. The soldiers heard
the whistle of a locomotive, and saw a train of
cars upon the Virginia Central road bringing
reinforcements to the Rebels. Captain Griffin's
batteries were brought up, and a vigorous fire
opened upon the railroad. The Twenty-second
Massachusetts and Second Maine were thrown
forward to the railroad. They tore up the track,
and cut the telegraph-wire, under cover of the
heavy fire of the artillery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>While this was transpiring on the Ashland
road, there was a sharp contest on the road leading
to Hanover. The Rebel infantry, concealed
in the woods, opened a rapid fire upon the
Twenty-fifth New York, which killed Lieutenant
Fisk and wounded Lieutenant-Colonel Savage,
and a number of the men. The Rebels sprang
from the woods upon the regiment, and captured
several prisoners. Colonel Johnson, commanding
the regiment, fell back upon the reserve, which
was coming into position in the rear, composed
of the Seventeenth New York, Eighty-third Pennsylvania
in the front line, and the Twelfth New
York and Sixteenth Michigan in the second.
They charged over the field, through the hollow,
up the slope beyond, and came upon the Rebel
batteries by the farm-house so rapidly, and with
such force, that they captured a twelve-pound
gun, which the enemy had not time to remove.
The Rebels retreated towards the Court-House,
followed by the cavalry, and all the artillery and
infantry except Martindale's brigade. General
Martindale sent two of his regiments up the railroad
to join the main force at the Court-House,
while he remained with the Second Maine,
Twenty-fifth New York, a portion of the Forty-fourth
New York, and two guns of Martin's
battery.</p>

<p>While waiting and resting with this small
force, after the exciting encounter of the afternoon,
he was suddenly attacked by the Rebels,
who greatly outnumbered him, and who by a
surprise hoped to rout and defeat him, and cut
off General Porter from the main command. But
for more than an hour he held his ground, till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
the column which had gone to the Court-House
turned back and rejoined him.</p>

<p>As soon as General Porter heard the firing, he
moved the Thirteenth and Fourteenth New York
and Griffin's batteries down the road upon the
double-quick. The Ninth Massachusetts and
Sixty-second Pennsylvania were sent through the
woods, across the angle between the Hanover
and Ashland roads, while the Eighty-third
Pennsylvania and Sixteenth Michigan pushed
down the railroad. The troops last named moved
with great rapidity. They came suddenly upon
the left flank of the enemy. The Rebels evidently
were not expecting to be attacked from that quarter.
They fled through the woods in great confusion.
The cavalry rode among them, and hundreds
threw down their arms and gave themselves
up as prisoners.</p>

<p>General McClellan, in his Report, thus speaks
of this gallant affair: "Some two hundred of the
enemy's dead were buried by our troops, seven
hundred and thirty prisoners sent to the rear,
one twelve-pound howitzer, one caisson, a large
number of small arms, and two railroad trains
captured." The Union loss amounted to fifty-three
killed and three hundred and forty-four
wounded and missing.</p>

<p>The force encountered was General Branch's
division of North Carolina and Georgia troops,
numbering about nine thousand. Their camp
at Hanover Court-House was taken and destroyed.</p>

<p>General Porter fell back to Coal Harbor. The
engineers made a survey of the Chickahominy
and of the approaches to Richmond, and began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
build bridges across the stream and throw up
earthworks.</p>

<p>The days were hot and sultry. There were
heavy thunder-storms, succeeded by intense heat.
The soldiers were provided with axes and shovels,
and were set to work in the dark, miry swamps,
working all day up to their waists in the muddy
water. Disease in all its frightful forms of fever
and dysentery made its appearance. The air was
full of malaria. Hundreds died and thousands
were sent to the hospitals.</p>

<p>One day a fine youth, who with ardor and enthusiasm
had enlisted as a soldier, was brought
into the hospital. He had been taken violently
and suddenly with fever while in the marshes.
The nurses laid him on a cot, gave him cold
water, bathed his hot brows. He had a likeness
of his mother, who had gone into the better land,
and of his sister, who was far away in his pleasant
home, in a gold locket on his neck. He
dreamed and talked of home, and said, "I have
a sister on my heart,&mdash;a sister on my heart,&mdash;a
sister,&mdash;a sister."</p>

<p>The disease made rapid progress. The fever
burned within,&mdash;a consuming flame which, before
sunrise, had devoured all his young life. He
was buried in the afternoon beneath the forest
trees.</p>

<p>It was wearing work, the bridge-building, the
construction of roads, and throwing up of intrenchments.
Besides, there was the necessity
of keeping close watch upon the enemy. If there
were sad scenes, there were also amusing incidents.</p>

<p>A party of Maine boys, on picket, one day, saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
a pair of wagon-wheels. Not far off were the
Rebel pickets, in an open field. The Down-East
Yankees thought they would have some fun.
They mounted a log upon the wheels, brought the
mock cannon into position. One of them pretended
to sponge it, another put in the cartridge,
a third primed, a fourth sighted it, while a fifth
stood ready to fire. The Rebels watched the operation
a moment, and then scampered for the
woods to get under cover! The Maine boys did
not fire, but had a merry chuckle among themselves,
and a hearty laugh with their comrades
when they told the story in camp.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<h3>FAIR OAKS.</h3>


<p><span class="firstwords">Seven</span> miles from Richmond, near the York
River Railroad, there is a grove of oaks, so green,
so beautiful and fair, that the railroad station
has received the name of Fair Oaks. A highway
from Richmond crosses the railroad near the station
called the Nine-Mile Road. The railroad
runs east and the Nine-Mile Road southeast. The
highway from Richmond to Williamsburg runs
parallel to the railroad about a mile south of it,
and is crossed by the Nine-Mile Road, a mile
southeast from Fair Oaks. At the junction of
the two highways are seven pines, standing in a
cluster on the south side of the Williamsburg
road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>The country around is level and covered mainly
by a dense forest, but there is cleared land along
the Williamsburg road toward Richmond. On
the 23d of May, General Keyes was ordered to
advance to Fair Oaks and hold the position.
General Couch's division was halted at Seven
Pines, while Casey's was thrown forward to Fair
Oaks, encamped on Baker's farm. General
Keyes cut down the trees in front of his line beyond
Fair Oaks to form an abattis. They were
also felled in front of Couch.</p>

<p>On Friday night, the 30th of May, there was a
terrific thunder-storm. The heavens were sheets
of flame, and the clouds poured torrents of water
which deluged the country and flooded the Chickahominy.</p>

<p>Early in the morning on Saturday, the 31st, it
was whispered in the Rebel camp that General
Johnston was going to attack the Yankees who
were South of the Chickahominy.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>"In such weather?" it was asked.</p>

<p>"The bridges are washed away, and it is impossible
for McClellan to send over his right and
center to the assistance of his left. His army is
divided, and we can crush the force on the
south side before he can reinforce it," was the answer.</p>

<p>General Huger's division moved out from Richmond
at six o'clock, taking the Charles City road,
which is south of the Williamsburg road, and
which runs south of White-Oak Swamp. He was
to make a long and rapid march east, then turn
north, cross the Swamp, gain the rear of General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
Couch, and cut off his retreat to Bottom's Bridge.
He was to reach his position and begin the attack
at eight o'clock. General Longstreet's division
moved down the Williamsburg road and halted in
the woods. General Whiting moved down the
Nine-Mile Road and halted in the woods in front
of Fair Oaks.</p>

<p>President Davis and his Cabinet went out with
Longstreet to see the fight. Eight o'clock&mdash;nine
o'clock&mdash;ten&mdash;passed, and there was no sound of
Huger's guns. He was toiling in the mud, moving
at a snail's pace. Longstreet and Whiting
were impatiently waiting, concealed from observation
in the woods.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock, General Keyes's pickets captured
an aide of General Johnston in the edge of
the woods. He was brought before General
Keyes. While the General was talking with him,
two musket-shots were fired in the woods, which
produced an emotion in the young officer so
marked that it was noticed by General Keyes,
who feared that something might be going on in
his front, and who immediately issued orders for
his troops to be under arms.</p>

<p>Eleven o'clock came, and General Longstreet,
getting out of patience at Huger's delay, ordered
his troops to advance and begin the attack. His
skirmishers went through the woods quickly, and
came upon Casey's skirmishers on the Williamsburg
road, and the firing began. But his regiments
were slow in getting on. His artillery
sank in the mud.</p>

<p>The rapid increase of the fire along the picket
line alarmed General Keyes, who made quick
preparations for whatever might happen.</p>

<p>Casey's division faced towards Richmond; Naglee's
brigade was on the railroad,&mdash;two regiments
north of it; Wessell's brigade was in the center,
near "Fair Oaks," and Palmer's was on the left,
south of the Williamsburg road. Spratt's battery
was near the Oaks. Regan's battery was in
rear of Spratt's. Bates's battery was south of
the Williamsburg road, in a redoubt, while Fitch's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
battery was in rear of the redoubt. Couch's division
at Seven Pines was lying with Graham's
brigade between the Williamsburg road and the
railroad, Devens's brigade on the Williamsburg
road, and Peck's brigade on the left.</p>

<p>Up to twelve o'clock there was little firing
except by the pickets, and the men in Casey's
command laid aside their arms and prepared to
eat dinner. Soon after noon two shells were
thrown into Casey's camp.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a heavy roll of musketry in
the woods. Officers sprang to their feet. They
knew that it portended trouble. There was a
quick saddling of horses and buckling on of belts.
Orders were issued in imperious tones.</p>

<p>The men left their coffee-pots and plates of rice,
seized their guns, and formed in line.</p>

<p>Casey's division was composed of undisciplined
troops which had joined the army after its arrival
upon the Peninsula. The men had had no
experience, and yet they were placed in advance,
nearest the enemy,&mdash;an oversight which was
dearly paid for.</p>

<p>The force which Johnston had brought out numbered
not far from thirty thousand. Casey's
division numbered not far from seven thousand.
Like an avalanche was the advance of the Rebels
upon this small, undisciplined force. Generals
Anderson, D.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Hill, Jenkins, Pegram, and Wilcox
swept along the Williamsburg road, striking
Palmer's brigade on the left flank.</p>

<p>General Casey's pickets were but a short distance
from camp, and they came streaming back
in confusion, followed by the Rebels in masses.
General Keyes saw that it was no feint, but an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
attack by an overwhelming force. He despatched
a messenger to General Heintzelman, who was
behind him towards Bottom's Bridge, for reinforcements.
The firing became quick and heavy.
General Sumner, three miles distant across the
Chickahominy, heard it, and ordered his command
under arms. The aide sent to Heintzelman
lost his way in the woods, and was a long while
in bearing the important message. Keyes saw
that there was danger on Casey's left, south of
the Williamsburg road, where the Rebels were
appearing in great force, and he ordered Peck's
brigade of Couch's division to advance and support
Palmer. Spratt's battery, near Fair Oaks,
opened upon the Rebels as they came through
the woods on the right, supported by the Eleventh
Maine, One Hundredth New York, One Hundred
and Fourth Pennsylvania, and Ninety-Second
New York.</p>

<p>In the center, the One Hundred and Third
Pennsylvania was sent forward to sustain the
pickets, but quickly returned in confusion.</p>

<p>The Rebel lines came into the open field, following
the retreating pickets. All of Casey's
guns opened with canister, and the fire was so
severe that General Hill ordered his men to lie
down, as it was impossible to advance in the face
of such a storm.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> General Hill dismounted from
his horse, and criticised the fire of the different
batteries. Longstreet's line was more than a
mile in extent, and yet Huger and Whiting had
not fired a cartridge. The fire was so terrible
from the batteries, and from Palmer's, Wessell's,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
and Naglee's lines, that Longstreet changed his
plan of attack, and, instead of advancing directly
upon the center, attacked on both flanks. Some
of his regiments filed towards the south, and
crept through the bushes unseen by Casey. The
others moved north, some in front of Naglee,
and prepared to charge upon Spratt's battery.
General Casey saw the plan. He rode along
the line, called upon three of Naglee's regiments
to drive the enemy into the woods. There was a
rail-fence between the combatants, but the troops
sprang over it with a cheer, formed in line, and
fought the enemy face to face. The battle raged
with great fury around the Oaks.</p>

<p>The enemy was held in check a few minutes
by the three regiments, but, being superior, advanced
once more, firing as they came on. Naglee
held his ground till the fighting was at close
quarters,&mdash;till some of the Eleventh Maine were
bayoneted. The order to retreat was given, and
the lines fell back, followed closely by the enemy,
who made a rush for Spratt's battery, and captured
one of the guns.</p>

<p>Elated, the Rebels halted to reform their lines,
before pushing on to other successes. But while
re-forming, Bates and Fitch opened wide gaps in
their ranks at every discharge of grape and canister.
Once more they came on, shouting and
screaming, and delivering their volleys and receiving
the steady fire streaming from the rifles
of Naglee's line, reinforced now by a regiment
from General Peck's brigade of Couch's division.</p>

<p>Their line of march is from southwest to
northeast. They come upon the left of Naglee's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
position, curling round his flank, and pouring a
cross fire into the rifle-pits. Colonel Bailey,
Major Van Valkenburg, and Adjutant Ramsey
of the artillery are killed, other officers are
wounded. The advancing host leap over the
slight earthworks, seize the guns, and prepare to
turn them upon the backs of the men on Naglee's
right. It is no use to contend for the ground or
the guns against the superior force, and the men
fall back once more. Casey's whole line also
retreats to that held by General Couch.</p>

<p>Up to this moment, Longstreet's grand division
only has been engaged; but two regiments
of General Couch's division, who are moving up
the railroad to support Naglee, see across the
field beyond the Fair Oaks long lines of men,&mdash;some
standing in battle line, and others advancing
in column along the railroad. It is Whiting,
who is deploying his forces from the Nine-Mile
Road.</p>

<p>General Couch is made acquainted with the
fact. He sends for the other two regiments of
the brigade. Whiting pours his troops into the
gap between Naglee and Couch, and cuts off the
four regiments from the troops at Seven Pines.</p>

<p>The regiments thus isolated are thrown back
towards Grape-Vine Bridge.</p>

<p>While this is transpiring on the right, there is
disaster in the center, and on the left. The
Rebels there are pushing on. Keyes rallies his
troops. He sends forward regiment after regiment
from his second line, to strengthen that in
front, to hold his ground if possible, but it is
growing thin. It sways to and fro, and breaks
at last. It crumbles, piecemeal,&mdash;the troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
hastening towards the Seven Pines. He has one
regiment still in reserve,&mdash;the Tenth Massachusetts.</p>

<p>He throws it into the broken gap. It requires
nerve and muscle to march in where all are fleeing,&mdash;to
be a breakwater <a name="tn_png_97"></a><!--TN: "were" changed to "where" on Page 96-->where the flood sweeps
all before it. But the regiment goes in as cheerfully
as to a dress-parade. They deliver their
volleys with deliberate aim. They hold their
ground.</p>

<p>Three hundred yards in the rear, Heintzelman,
Keyes, Casey, Naglee, and other officers are rallying
the men. Fugitives are stopped, regiments
which have been so stubbornly contesting the
ground are induced to try it once more.</p>

<p>"Had that regiment been two minutes later,"
says General Keyes, "they would have been too
late to occupy that fine position, and it would have
been impossible to have formed the next and last
line of battle, which stemmed the tide of defeat
and turned it toward a victory."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p>Thus far the Rebels have had it all their own
way. Casey has been driven a mile. His camp
is in the hands of Longstreet. He has lost many
guns. Longstreet has made so good a beginning
that, although Huger has not made his appearance
from the South, the prospect is good for
overwhelming the Union force on the southern
bank.</p>

<p>But other actors arrive upon the ground,&mdash;the
men who tossed their knapsacks into the woods
at Williamsburg,&mdash;who became a wall of adamant
on that memorable field. Berry and Jame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>son
march up the Williamsburg road and move
out upon the left of the line forming behind the
Tenth Massachusetts. Berry pushes down into
the border of the swamp; Jameson sends one
regiment to Peck and one to Birney, and moves
straight on towards the abattis of fallen trees in
front of Couch's line along the Williamsburg road
with his two remaining regiments. His men lie
down behind the fallen trees and pour their volleys
into the advancing foe, moving on in stately
grandeur. Jameson, unmindful of the storm
around him, rides up and down the line, exposed
to the fire of the enemy, not a hundred yards
distant. Sheltered by the abattis, his two regiments
are immovable. Like a hillock in the path
of an avalanche, they turn the overwhelming force
aside. It flows round them, right and left, but
does not advance along the road.</p>

<p>Berry, far down in the woods towards White
Oak Swamp, is pouring a terrible fire upon the
masses, who still press toward Seven Pines.
He holds them in check, repulsing all the assaults.
There, in the thickest of the fight, is that
young officer who made his last will and testament
at Yorktown,&mdash;the "hero of the day" at
Williamsburg,&mdash;animating the troops by his fearless
daring, and there he gives his life to his
country, shot through the brain.</p>

<p>In the rear of Seven Pines is the hospital, full
of weak and sickly men, prostrated by fevers.
They hear the tide of battle rolling nearer hour
by hour. A soldier from the front says that the
line is giving way and the Rebels are sweeping
all before them. The words fall on the ears of
Lieutenant Rice, of the Eleventh Maine. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
springs to his feet, and grasps a gun. "All
of you who can hold up your heads, follow
me!" he shouts.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> Men who have not been able to
stand upon their feet spring up at the word.
They are pale, sallow, emaciated, with sunken eyes
and hollow cheeks. They form in line, twenty of
them, seize their muskets. The fever is consuming
them, but there is a warmer flame within their
breasts,&mdash;the unquenchable desire to save their
comrades from defeat and their country from
destruction. Lieutenant Rice leads the weak and
tottering party to the front. He moves on close
to the enemy. He is one of the best marksmen
of his regiment, and soldier after soldier falls
from the ranks of the enemy by his unerring aim.
He fires seven times, and then goes down before
the bullets of the foe.</p>

<p>There is Willie Parker of the Eleventh Maine,
a mere boy, who beholds the Rebel colors advancing
from the woods, borne by a stalwart soldier.</p>

<p>"That flag must come down!" he says, as he
raises his gun. There is a flash, a screaming in
the air, as the swiftly-whirling bullet passes on.
The color-bearer reels, staggers, and falls.</p>

<p>There is Sergeant Katon, the standard-bearer
of the Eleventh, holding up, as high as he can
reach, the broken flag-staff, while kneeling beside
the dead body of Corporal Maddocks, who has
fallen while guarding the torn and tattered but
precious standard,&mdash;all this while the tempest
surges around them, over them, through them;
the very blast of death!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>An officer with one hundred men, who has been
out on picket, comes up the road.</p>

<p>"Where is my regiment?" he asks of the grim
and veteran Heintzelman.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you, sir."</p>

<p>"But I would like to join it."</p>

<p>"Very well, but if it is fighting you want, just
go in, Colonel, for there is good fighting all along
the line."</p>

<p>The battle rages furiously. Five o'clock&mdash;six
o'clock&mdash;half past six&mdash;Berry holds them by the
swamp, Jameson holds them with his three hundred
men on the Williamsburg road; but between
Seven Pines and Fair Oaks the tide is drifting on.</p>

<p>Jameson resolves to advance. The Rebels in
front of him fall back along the road to Richmond.
Thus, while Whiting is pushing east
over the Nine-Mile Road, Jameson is marching
west towards the Rebel capital, driving all before
him.</p>

<p>"Fall back" is the imperative order which he
receives. He would a great deal rather go on.</p>

<p>"What would you have done, if you had not
been ordered back?" a friend asked.</p>

<p>"I would have been in Richmond or in Heaven
before night," was the reply.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p>But he obeys orders. Yet he cannot go back
the way he advanced; the enemy is between him
and Seven Pines. He faces south, picks his way
through White Oak Swamp, comes round to
Seven Pines, and again confronts the enemy.</p>

<p>The day is closing. Darkness is coming on.
The Yankees are not yet swept into the Chickahominy.
Longstreet has had success, but it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
not a great victory. The Union line has been
pushed back a mile and a half. It has been
broken,&mdash;almost disorganized. Berry's brigade
is as firm and solid as ever. Jameson's has been
divided and sent to different parts of the field.
Casey's division has crumbled. Couch's has
been broken. A great crowd of stragglers is
moving towards Bottom's Bridge. Couch with
two regiments and a battery have been pushed
north towards Grape Vine Bridge. Such is
the position at seven o'clock, as Whiting, fresh
and vigorous, brings his brigade down the railroad
to finish the work of this day.</p>

<p>But now there is another actor,&mdash;General
Sumner, who has crossed the Chickahominy at
Grape-Vine Bridge, and is pushing on with
Sedgwick's gallant division.</p>

<p>General Sumner ordered his corps to be under
arms at one o'clock. As the firing grew
loud, he moved his troops to the Chickahominy
and waited for orders to cross. He commenced
crossing at three o'clock, but the swamp was
flooded, and it was only by great exertion and
perseverance that he was able to get Kirby's
battery to the south bank.</p>

<p>Gorman's brigade led the column, composed of
the First Minnesota, Fifteenth Massachusetts,
Second New York Volunteers, and Thirty-Fourth
New York,&mdash;Gorman joined General Couch.
Kirby, with his six Napoleon guns, followed, and
Dana's brigade closed the column, composed of the
Nineteenth and Twentieth Massachusetts, Seventh
Michigan, and Forty-Second New York.
General Sumner rapidly formed his line, facing
south. Whiting, up to this time, had been press<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>ing
straight on towards the Seven Pines. He
turned to crush this new force which had appeared
unexpectedly on his flank.</p>

<p>It is a cloudy night and darkness is stealing on,
as the Rebels change their front and move towards
the north to sweep all before them. They advance
across the field and through the woods, delivering
a rapid fire. Suddenly there bursts a
sheet of flame from Sumner's ranks.</p>

<p>The Rebels fall back, rally their broken lines,
advance again, nearer and with desperation.
"Canister! Canister! Give them canister!" is
Kirby's order as he moves from gun to gun. The
battle-cloud grows thick beneath the heavy vapors
rising from the swamp. Quick, incessant flashes
momentarily light up the deepening darkness.
It is not possible for men to face so terrible a
storm. Vain are all the efforts of the Rebel
officers to rally their bleeding ranks.</p>

<p>Sumner has stood his ground. The time has
come to advance. The Thirty-Fourth and Forty-Second
New York, Fifteenth and Twentieth Massachusetts,
and Seventh Michigan move forward.</p>

<p>There are two fences in front of them, and beyond
the farthest one is the Rebel line waiting
their advance. The soldiers know that it will be
the last march of many, but with a cheer heard
above the roar of battle, they rush into the darkness,
dash the fences under foot, and spring upon
the enemy's lines. It is the work of a minute.
One short struggle, a volley, a holding of the
breath, muttered curses, shouts, groans, a clashing
of bayonets, the trampling of ten thousand
feet, and the field is clear of the enemy!</p>

<p>General Johnston has failed in what he intend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>ed
to accomplish. He is borne from the field at
this hour, wounded by a shell from Kirby's
battery.</p>

<p>"As I rode down through the field," says a
Rebel officer, "I met Franks, one of Longstreet's
aides, looking as blue as indigo. What is the
matter, Franks? Not satisfied with the day's
work?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Satisfied be hanged! I saw old Jeff, Mallory,
Longstreet, and Whiting, and all of them,
looking as mad as thunder. Just to think that
Huger's slowness has spoiled everything! There
he has been on our right all day and hasn't fired
a shot, although he had positive orders to open
the fight at eight o'clock in the morning."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>There are indescribable scenes of horror after
a great battle,&mdash;the removal of the wounded,
bleeding, dying, giving utterances to groans extorted
by the intense pain,&mdash;the work at the hospitals,
where the disabled, one by one, are laid
before the surgeons. Yet, amid their terrible sufferings,
the men are often cheerful, and hopeful
for this life and the life which is to come.</p>

<p>A chaplain says: "Amongst the badly wounded
was Joseph Bynon of Alleghany City, Pennsylvania,
a young man of the most generous nature,
universally popular in his regiment, and
the staff of a widowed mother. He was lying on
a blanket near the house, wounded in the bowels.
I asked him about his sufferings. He replied, that
he did not suffer much, that he was faint from
the loss of blood as he supposed. I saw from his
pulse that he had but a few moments to live, and
said to him,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Joseph, are you willing and ready to die? I
am afraid you cannot live.'</p>

<p>"'Well, doctor,' he whispered, 'I should like
to live; I love my mother; this will be a great
sorrow to her. And I should like to do something
for my little nephew and niece. But there is another
life, and I know I shall find mother there.
I feel I have been a great sinner; in many things
I have done wrong; but ever since my conversion
I experienced in Camp Johnson, I have tried to
follow my Saviour, and now I die trusting. My
mind wanders; I find it difficult to think and
speak. In praying to God, I may not say the
things that are right; do, doctor, lift up my hands
and clasp them together, and pray for me!'</p>

<p>"I lifted up the hands crimsoned with his own
blood, and pressing them in mine, commended him
to the Merciful One, who for us all had suffered
the bitterness of death. He repeated word for
word, prayed for his mother, and then said, 'O
Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the
world, take away my sin; into Thine hand I commend
my spirit!'</p>

<p>"The storm of battle raged again. The enemy's
shells burst around the hospital, and the
wounded were removed. He was lifted into an
ambulance, but died before it reached Savage
Station. Thus giving his life to his country, he
passed on into the service of his God."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>At daybreak on Sunday morning, an orderly
belonging to the Rebel army rode out of the
woods into the Union lines.</p>

<p>"Where is General Anderson," he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here he is. What do you want of him?" said
a colonel.</p>

<p>"I have a despatch for him from General
Pryor."</p>

<p>"I will take it. Soldiers, guard this man. You
are my prisoner."</p>

<p>The orderly was much astonished to find himself
a prisoner. The despatch gave information
of the disposition of the Rebel forces for the battle
soon to recommence.</p>

<p>During the night the balance of Sumner's corps
crossed the Chickahominy, and at daybreak the
troops, thus strengthened, were able to renew
the battle. Sedgwick remained where he fought
on Saturday. Richardson's division was next on
his right. He formed in two lines,&mdash;with French's
brigade in front on the railroad, and Howard and
Meagher in the second line in his rear. Kearney,
Couch, and Hooker, with the remnants of Casey's
division, were in the vicinity of Seven Pines.</p>

<p>It would require many pages to give in detail
the fight of Sunday morning. It must be given
as a picture.</p>

<p>It began at five o'clock. At that hour, the
Rebels are discovered south of the railroad in
the woods in front of Richardson. Pettit opens
with shells, and the stillness of the Sabbath is
broken by deep reverberations rolling along the
Chickahominy. There is a gap between Richardson
and Kearney. Richardson moves toward
Seven Pines to close it. From the woods where
Pettit drops his shells, there is a volley&mdash;another&mdash;another&mdash;and
the men drop from Richardson's
ranks. The Rebels advance and attack French's
brigade at short range. For an hour the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
stand in their places, and deliver their fire upon
the columns which are pushed against them.
Reinforcements come up from Longstreet's reserves.
Howard is brought up from the second
line to meet them. His horse is shot. He is twice
wounded in the right arm, and is forced to leave
the field. His arm is shattered, and the surgeon
says it must come off. He meets Kearney, who
lost his left arm years ago.</p>

<p>"We will buy our gloves together, Kearney,"
is the salutation of this Christian soldier and
patriot.</p>

<p>But the onset of his brigade is magnificent.
The rebel line is shattered by the resistless charge.</p>

<p>Hooker comes up the railroad. He falls like a
thunderbolt upon the enemy in front, breaking,
dividing, shattering them. They flee in confusion.
Sickles is advancing along the Williamsburg
road, Berry and Jameson are moving over
the ground of Saturday between the Seven Pines
and White-Oak Swamp. Richardson and Sedgwick
are also in motion. From Fair Oaks to the
swamp south of Seven Pines, the Union line advances
over the bloody field. It is like the swinging
of a wide gate, with its hinges near Fair Oaks,
and reaching past Seven Pines to the swamp.</p>

<p>It is a triumphant march. The Rebels have
failed in what they attempted, and are fleeing
with broken, demoralized ranks to Richmond.
Hats, caps, blankets, knapsacks, guns, all are
thrown aside. The road is filled with the fleeing
fugitives. Heintzelman and Sumner press on
within four miles of the city. No troops oppose
them.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt but we might have gone right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
into Richmond," says General Heintzelman.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>&mdash;"I
think that if the army had pressed after the
enemy with great vigor, we should have gone to
Richmond," is the opinion of General Keyes.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p>"They (the Federals) missed an opportunity of
striking a decisive blow. These opportunities
never returned," writes Prince de Joinville of
France.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>General McClellan recalled the troops from
their pursuit, and established his lines as they
were on the morning of Saturday.</p>

<p>The loss on the Union side was 5,737. The
Rebel loss, as reported in Smith's, Longstreet's,
and Hill's divisions, was 6,783. Whiting's division
also suffered severely, so that the entire Rebel
loss was about 8,000.</p>

<p>A month passed by. General McClellan was
preparing for a siege. There were six bridges
built across the Chickahominy, which required
labor day and night. The men were obliged to
work up to their arms in the water. Miles of
corduroy roads were constructed. The ground
was so swampy and marshy that nothing could
be done by horses. All the timber hauled to construct
the bridges and the batteries was drawn
by the men. The month of June was rainy.
There were frequent storms, succeeded by hot
sunshine. Sickness, in all its frightful forms,
made its appearance. The men became discouraged.
It was expected, day after day, that
the attack would commence; but the commanding
officers issued orders that no batteries should
open till all were ready. The army, meanwhile,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
began to be depleted of troops. Thousands were
sent to the hospitals, and other thousands were
carried out to their last resting-place, on the
banks of the dark, dismal, sluggish stream, which
soon became the river of death.</p>

<p>Reinforcements were called for and received:
McCall's division of Pennsylvania Reserves, which
reached the army on the 12th and 13th of June.</p>

<p>On the night of the 13th, General Stewart,
with 1,800 Rebel cavalry, appeared in rear of the
army. He came first upon two squadrons of
Regular cavalry, at Hanover Old Church, overpowering
and capturing them; then pushed on to
Gorlick's Landing, on the Pamunkey, burning two
schooners and fourteen wagons; then moved to
the railroad at Tunstall's Station.</p>

<p>The train first arriving was one going east with
sick and wounded men. The engineer saw the
cavalrymen on the track as he rounded a curve.
They motioned him to stop, but he put on more
steam, and the train rushed past with lightning
speed. Hundreds of bullets were aimed at him,
but he escaped unharmed.</p>

<p>General Stewart crossed the Chickahominy at
Long Bridge, below Bottom's Bridge, and came
upon a Union hospital at Baltimore Cross Roads.
He placed a guard over the hospital, and treated
the sick men humanely. But the fright was very
disastrous to many who found themselves thus
suddenly in the hands of the enemy. Several
died during the night. In the pockets of one
Union soldier, after death, the chaplain found
some touching and beautiful letters from a little
brother and sister, telling him how much they
missed him, how they longed for his return, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
they counted the days until he might come back,
but above all telling how proud they were of their
soldier brother. And they never heard a drum
beat nor a fife play without thinking of him, and
feeling glad that they had one noble brother to
fight for their country.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<h3>SEVEN DAYS OF FIGHTING.</h3>


<p><span class="firstwords">The</span> chances for taking Richmond became less
with each day's delay. While the Army of
the Potomac were digging and delving in the
swamps, and constructing batteries, their ranks
thinning out by disease, the Rebels, also, were
hard at work erecting defensive batteries, on firm
ground, and mounting guns of large caliber.
Their ranks, instead of growing thin, were filling
up. Troops were hurried in from all parts of
the South. The Conscript law which the Confederate
Congress had passed was in operation,
and was carried out with remorseless energy.
Men were compelled to enter the service.</p>

<p>The Union army in front of Richmond, on the
20th of June, numbered, fit for duty, 115,102 men.
There were 12,225 sick, and 20,511 absent. Leaves
of absence and furloughs had been granted freely.
Officers and men, on a slight pretext, found it not
very difficult to obtain leave of absence, and thus
this army, through no fault of the government,
became greatly depleted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>At this time General Jackson was in the Shenandoah
Valley with a large force. By his operations
there, it was found necessary to keep General
McDowell in position to cover Washington.
On the 18th of June, General McClellan informed
the Secretary of War that deserters said troops
were on their way from Richmond to reinforce
Jackson.</p>

<p>On the same day, a man entered the Union
lines at Fredericksburg, who pretended to be a
Frenchman. He stated that he met from ten to
fifteen thousand men on their way to Gordonsville,
going to join Jackson.</p>

<p>A despatch was also received from General
Sigel, who was in the Valley, that a large body
of Rebels had arrived at Gordonsville.</p>

<p>All of this went to show that a grand movement
was to be made in the Valley, or upon Washington.
Such, undoubtedly, the Rebel commanders
intended the government at Washington
should understand their plan to be. But they
had no intention of marching down the Shenandoah
Valley, or of attacking Washington. They
wished to prevent any more reinforcements from
joining General McClellan, and also to cover their
real point of attack.</p>

<p>General McClellan's army was still divided by
the Chickahominy. Sumner, Heintzelman, and
Keyes were on the south side, and Porter and
Franklin, with McCall's newly arrived troops,
were on the north bank.</p>

<p>The real object of the Rebels was to crush the
force on the north bank by a sudden stroke with
their whole army. By the movement to Gordonsville
they allayed suspicion, and transferred a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
division to a position from which it could be
hurled upon the flank of General McClellan's
force on the northern bank.</p>

<p>All of the railroad cars and engines which could
be obtained were brought to Richmond over the
Lynchburg road. Whiting's and Ewell's divisions
were placed on board and taken to Lynchburg,
and thence to Gordonsville where they joined
Jackson; but not stopping there, were brought
with Jackson's army to Frederickshall, on the
Virginia Central Railroad. From thence this
large force marched to Ashland, arriving there
on the 25th.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p>General McClellan was informed by a deserter,
on the 24th, that Jackson, Whiting, and Ewell
were at Frederickshall, and that it was intended
to attack his rear on the 28th.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> The information
was confirmed on the 25th by negroes who arrived
at the Union lines, and stated that Jackson was
at Hanover Court-House.</p>

<p>General McClellan's lines were more than
twenty miles in length. His extreme right was
north of the city of Richmond, on the road called
the Brooke Turnpike. No change was made in
the position of the troops, no breastworks were
thrown up to protect the rear and flank. The
only change was the removal of the head-quarters'
camp to the south side of the Chickahominy.
General Fitz-John Porter was left in command
of the troops on the north side.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 26th, the Rebel forces in
Richmond moved out to join Jackson. General
Branch's division marched by the Brooke road.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
General A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;Hill moved over the Mechanicsville
Turnpike; while General Longstreet and
General D.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Hill took the Coal-Harbor road
still farther east, and came to the Chickahominy
at New Bridge. General Magruder, with one
division, was left on the south side of the stream.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>
The Rebel force north of the Chickahominy numbered
about 60,000; south of it, about 20,000.
The Union army north numbered about 30,000;
south, 70,000.</p>


<h3><a name="Mechanics"></a>BATTLE OF MECHANICSVILLE.</h3>

<p>If we were to start in a skiff at the bridge on
the Brooke road, and float down the slow and
winding Chickahominy three miles, we should
come first to Meadow Bridge, on the road leading
from Richmond to Shady-Grove Church. Two
miles farther would bring us to the Mechanicsville
Turnpike. The little village of Mechanicsville
is two miles towards the north. Two miles
below the Mechanicsville Bridge is the Upper
Trestle Bridge, built by General McClellan. Two
miles farther down is New Bridge, on the road
leading from Richmond to Coal Harbor. There
is a high hill on the south side of the stream, on
the plantation of Dr. Lewis, where the Rebels
had a battery which commanded the bridge and
prevented General McClellan from using it.
There was also a battery on the north side, which
General McClellan had planted to prevent the
Rebels from crossing at that point, and cutting
off the force which he had advanced to Mechanicsville.
Still farther down the stream were other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
bridges which had been erected by General McClellan's
engineers.</p>

<p>At noon the enemy was seen advancing upon
Meadow Bridge. The long column descended the
bank, forded the stream above the bridge, and
disappeared in the woods.</p>

<p>The Bucktails, who had driven Stewart at
Dranesville, were sent out to support the pickets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
but were surprised to see a body of cavalry dashing
into the road behind them. They faced about,
drove the cavalry, fell back to Mechanicsville,
followed by the pickets.</p>

<p>General McCall, who commanded there, had
thrown up a line of breastworks on the east side
of the creek. He formed his troops on the slope,
with his batteries on the crest of the hill. General
Reynolds's brigade had the right, and General
Seymour's the left. General Meade's brigade was
brought up as a reserve. General Porter sent forward
Griffin's and Martindale's brigades, which
took position on the right of Reynolds. Having
thus formed his line, he waited the advance of the
enemy.</p>

<p>The force which came in sight first was A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;Hill's division, followed by General Branch's.</p>

<p>A short distance from the Chickahominy, on
the creek, was Ellison's Mills. The road from
Mechanicsville to New Bridge crossed the creek
at that point. Another road leading from Mechanicsville
to Coal Harbor crossed it farther up.
Timber had been felled, rifle-pits dug, and the
artillery planted so as to rake the only two feasible
approaches.</p>

<p>General Hill formed his line for the attack on
Ellison's Mills, while General Branch advanced
along the upper road against Reynolds.</p>

<p>The battle began at three o'clock, and raged
with fury till nine o'clock. There were no movements
in the Union lines. The men stood in their
places and poured an uninterrupted fire upon the
enemy, who were vainly endeavoring to cross the
ravine and scale the heights. The artillery, fifty
pieces, rained solid shot, shells, grape, canister,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
shrapnel, all sorts of missiles, producing great
slaughter.</p>

<p>General D.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Hill arrived with his division,
and joined in the attack upon Seymour at the
Mills, but was received with a "murderous fire."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p>The united efforts of the two Hills and General
Branch were not sufficient to dislodge the two
brigades which held the position. Griffin, Martindale,
and Meade were ready to lend assistance,
but were not engaged. Griffin only fired a few
shots. The Union loss was eighty killed and
about two hundred wounded. The Rebel loss is
supposed to have been nearly three thousand.
The assaults upon the rifle-pits were made with
great desperation, but the men could not get
through the impassable abattis, and were cut
down by the constant and steady fire of musketry
and canister at short range.</p>

<p>But the advance of General Jackson by Coal
Harbor made it necessary to withdraw the troops
from this strong position and concentrate the entire
force on the north bank, to cover the bridges
which had been constructed between the two
wings of the army. During the night General
McCall's division was withdrawn, contrary to the
remonstrances of the brave men who had held the
ground against five times their force; but they did
not know that Jackson was on their rear with
40,000 men.</p>

<p>General McClellan ordered the heavy guns and
all the baggage to be sent across the Chickahominy.
He had already meditated a retreat to the
James River.</p>

<p>"Run the cars to the last moment, and load<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
them with provisions and ammunition. Load
every wagon you have with subsistence, and send
them to Savage Station," was the order sent to
Colonel Ingalls, the Chief Quarter-Master at
White-House.</p>


<h3><a name="Gaines"></a>THE BATTLE OF GAINES'S MILLS.</h3>

<p>The battle which was fought on the 27th of
June is known in the South as the battle of Coal
Harbor; in the North, as the battle of Gaines's
Mills. General Fitz-John Porter commanded the
Union troops, and General Lee the Rebel army.</p>

<p>Starting from the Chickahominy and traveling
up the little creek which supplies Dr. Gaines's
Mill with water, we come to the battle-field, which
lies on our right hand, east of the creek. The
ravine is narrow and the banks on both sides are
steep. General Porter has cut down the trees
which stood on the hillside, and has thrown up
rifle-pits and intrenchments. He is to hold the
enemy in check, while General McClellan makes
preparations for a retreat to James River. He
has thirty thousand men against seventy thousand.
Commencing on the creek near the Chickahominy,
we see on our right hand General Morrell's
division, with Butterfield's, Martindale's,
and Griffin's brigades. Upon the other side is
Longstreet, A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;Hill, and Whiting.</p>

<p>General Griffin's brigade is south of the road
which comes down from Coal Harbor. Across
the road is General Sykes's division of regulars,
composed of Warren's, Chapman's and Buchanan's
brigades, confronted by Ewell's, D.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Hill's,
and Jackson's divisions. General Porter's second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
line at the beginning of the battle is composed
of McCall's division, stationed near the center, in
rear of Griffin. He has some cavalry on the road
leading to Alexander's Bridge.</p>

<p>Late in the day Slocum's division, of Sumner's
corps, crosses Sumner's Bridge and takes position
in rear of Sykes's.</p>

<p>It is a hot, sultry day. General Lee is at Hogan's
plantation, near New Coal-Harbor, sitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
beneath the portico of the farm-house, absorbed in
thought. He is neatly dressed in a gray uniform,
buttoned to the throat. Longstreet is sitting in
an old chair at the foot of the steps beneath the
trees, eating a lunch, with his feet against a tree,
his uniform faded and torn, buttons missing, and
his boots old and dusty. Gregg, Wilcox, Pryor,
Featherstone, and other generals are there waiting
for Jackson, who has been marching hard all
the morning to get into position. A courier comes
down the Coal-Harbor road, delivers a message to
Lee, who mounts his horse and rides away to New
Coal-Harbor.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p>It is past two o'clock in the afternoon before
Lee is ready to begin the attack. There has been
a cannonade all along the line north and south of
the Chickahominy. Magruder, on the south side,
has instructions to make a grand demonstration,
as if he was going to attack McClellan. It is his
intention to keep him from sending troops to
Porter's aid.</p>

<p>Lee intends to make a grand onset and sweep
Porter into the Chickahominy. Under cover of a
tremendous fire from the artillery, A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;Hill
begins the attack upon Griffin and Martindale,
but under the superior and effective fire of Captain
Griffin's United States battery, Weeden's
Rhode Island, and Allen's and Martin's Massachusetts
batteries, the Rebel batteries are "overpowered
and driven from the field."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> The Rebel
infantry advances through the belt of timber, and
descends the ravine. From the rifle-pits there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
are sudden flashes and quick spirts of flame, and
the battle-cloud becomes thick and heavy.</p>

<p>It would require many pages to make a full
record of the terrible combat. How Longstreet
urged his men into the woods,&mdash;how the battle
rolled through the forest and surged back again,&mdash;how
brigade after brigade marched against
Martindale, Griffin, and Butterfield, only to fall
back with broken and shattered ranks,&mdash;how the
ground became thick with the dead and wounded,&mdash;how
men fired into each other's faces and fell
almost into each other's arms, mingling their
life-blood in one crimson stream,&mdash;how Jackson
pressed on over the plain, urging his men nearer
and nearer,&mdash;how the Pennsylvania Reserves went
up to aid the Regulars,&mdash;how couriers dashed
through the woods, over the bridges to General
McClellan, who was on the southern bank, asking
for reinforcements,&mdash;how Slocum's division went
over, reached the field, held in check the dark
masses forming upon the flank of the Regulars
and Reserves, and held the ground. The hours
hung heavily. Three o'clock,&mdash;four o'clock,&mdash;five
o'clock,&mdash;and no break in the line. Thirty-five
thousand against seventy! But the pressure is
terrible. French's and Meagher's brigades are ordered
over. But moments are precious. Six
o'clock; the onset is greater than ever. Every
regiment, every man, is brought to the front, on
both sides. The artillery still thunders, but the
infantry are out of ammunition. Longstreet has
been hurled back as often as he has advanced,
and so has A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;Hill and D.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Hill, but Jackson
is working toward the Chickahominy on the
left. Sykes's men, who have been facing north,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
are obliged to face east to meet the troops moving
in a steady stream down the road leading to Old
Coal-Harbor. Men begin to leave the ranks and
move toward the rear. There is a desperate rush
from Jackson's brigades upon the guns. The
Union line gives way.</p>

<p>If there was a fresh division or a brigade even
at hand, the tide might be stopped. There are
sixty thousand men upon the southern bank of
the river, but General McClellan is afraid that
Magruder with his division will make an attack.</p>

<p>Whiting's division, which has been held in reserve
by Lee, is ordered up. All of his desperate
charges and onsets have failed. If Whiting fails,
the battle is lost.</p>

<p>The Regulars and the Pennsylvania Reserves
are worn out. Their ammunition is nearly gone.
Porter orders up his last man. They can have
no more support. At this moment, after they
have held at bay for four hours the great host,
they are called upon to withstand the last grand
charge of Jackson.</p>

<p>Whiting advances, he is received with grape and
canister. His line halts, wavers, almost breaks;
but Jackson, Whiting, Hood, and Law urge the
men to push on. They leap across the ravine, halt
a moment, sheltered by the bank above them from
the fire of the Union batteries, and then leap
the breastwork and <a name="tn_png_120"></a><!--TN: "sieze" changed to "seize" on Page 119-->seize the guns. There is a
short struggle, a falling back, a retreat, and the
battle of Gaines's Mills is lost to General McClellan.</p>

<p>Meagher and French have reached the field, but
they are too late to save the day. Twenty guns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
have fallen into Lee's hands, and several hundred
prisoners. The cavalry in the rear draw
their sabers, dash upon the exultant foe, but it is
an ineffectual charge. The retreating troops fall
in behind French and Meagher, form a new line
nearer the Chickahominy, as the darkness comes
on. They have been driven from their first position,
but Lee has not power enough to drive them
into the Chickahominy. He decides to wait till
morning before renewing the attack.</p>

<p>The morning dawns, and Porter is beyond his
reach across the river, with all his siege guns,
ammunition, and supplies.</p>

<p>How near Lee came to losing the battle may
be seen by the following extract from the narration
of a Rebel correspondent of the Richmond
Whig:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It was absolutely necessary that we should
carry their line, and, to do this, regiment after
regiment, and brigade after brigade was successively
led forward; still our repeated charges,
gallant and dashing though they were, failed to
accomplish the end, and our troops, still fighting,
fell steadily back. Thus for more than two mortal
hours the momentous issue stood trembling in the
balance. The sun was getting far in the west,
darkness would soon be upon us, and the point
must be carried. At this juncture&mdash;it was now
five o'clock&mdash;the division of the gallant Whiting
hove in sight. On reaching the field their troops
rapidly deployed in line.... The charge was
made under the most galling fire I ever witnessed;
shot, shell, grape, canister, and ball swept through
our lines like a storm of leaden hail, and our
noble boys fell thick and fast; and yet still, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
the irresistible determination of men who fight
for all that men hold dear, our gallant boys rushed
on.</p>

<p>"Suddenly a halt was made,&mdash;there was a deep
pause, and the line wavered from right to left.
We now saw the character of the enemy's works.
A ravine deep and wide yawned before us, while
from the other side of the crest of the almost
perpendicular bank, a breastwork of logs was
erected, from behind which the dastard invaders
were pouring murderous volleys upon our troops.
The pause made by our troops was but a brief
breathing space. The voice of Law was heard,
'Forward, boys! charge them!' and with a wild,
mad shout our impetuous soldiery dashed forward."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>


<h3><a name="James"></a>THE MOVEMENT TO JAMES RIVER.</h3>

<p>On the morning of the 28th, General Keyes
and General Porter, followed by long trains of
wagons and herds of cattle, moved towards the
south, through the dark forests of White-Oak
Swamp. At White-House landing, sloops, schooners,
barges, and steamers were departing for
Yorktown. At Savage Station the torch was applied
to all the stores which could not be removed.
Barrels of pork, beef, sugar, bags of coffee, boxes
of bread, were destroyed. A railroad train loaded
with ammunition was standing on the track. The
engine was ready for use. Far down the track,
there was a pillar of cloud rising from the burnt
bridge across the Chickahominy. The cars were
set on fire. The engineer stepped upon the en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>gine
for the last time, and pulled the throttle.
The wheels began to turn. He opened the valve
to its full width, and jumped upon the ground.
The engine sprang down the descending grade,
propelled by the pent-up power. It is two miles
from the station to the bridge, and over this distance
it rushed like an unchained tiger. Sparkling,
crackling, roaring with increasing velocity, dashing
along the fields, over the meadows, through
the forests, a trail of fire, a streaming banner of
flame and smoke, a linked thunderbolt, rumbling,
growling, exploding, leaping from the abutment
full forty feet, bursting into a million fragments,
jarring the earth with the mighty concussion,
and disappearing beneath the waters, a wreck, a
ruin forever!</p>

<p>General McClellan was obliged to leave some
of his sick and wounded. Many soldiers shed
tears as they bade a last farewell to their comrades.</p>

<p>"I would rather die than fall into the hands of
the Rebels," said one.</p>

<p>"O my God! is this the reward I deserve for all
the sacrifices I have made, the battles I have
fought, and the agony I have endured from
my wounds?"<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> was the despairing cry of another.</p>

<p>"Do not be ashamed of your cause. Defend it
boldly, and put your trust in God"; were the
words of one noble chaplain, Rev. Mr. Marks, who
would not leave them, but who remained to be a
prisoner for their sakes. They prayed together
and sang a hymn.</p>

<p>They were comforted, and resolved to meet
their fate like men.</p>

<p>The Rebels made no attack on Saturday. They
were compelled to repair the bridges which had
been destroyed, before they could cross the Chickahominy.
General Sumner commanded the rear-guard.
He retreated slowly on Saturday to Peach
Orchard, and halted to destroy the supplies.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning a portion of Lee's army
advanced to attack Sumner, who was at Peach
Orchard and Allen's Farm; but Hazard's and
Pettit's batteries, with Sedgwick's division,
quickly repulsed them.</p>


<h3><a name="Savage"></a>BATTLE OF SAVAGE STATION.</h3>

<p>Lee's divisions, one after another, filed across
the hastily repaired bridges. General Franklin
was north of the railroad. He saw them, and
sent word to General Sumner, who fell back with
Franklin to Savage Station. General Franklin
was on the right, Sumner in the center, and
Heintzelman nearer Richmond on the left. There
was a misunderstanding of orders; and General
Heintzelman moved across White-Oak Swamp,
which exposed Sumner's left flank to the enemy.</p>

<p>Through the long Sabbath hours, these troops
stood upon the wide plain facing northwest,
seemingly motionless almost as statues, while the
long wagon trains moved into the woods towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
the south. They were the rear-guard, and on
them depended the salvation of the army.</p>

<p>Following the wagons were thousands of sick
and wounded, working their way towards the
swamp, urged on by hope of escaping the hands of
the Rebels. It was heart-rending to hear the
words of those who were too badly wounded to be
moved, or who could not be taken away.</p>

<p>The sun went down. Evening was coming on,
yet the twenty thousand men remained upon that
field awaiting the attack,&mdash;three lines of resolute,
determined men. Brooks's, Hancock's, and
Burns's brigades were in front; with Osborn's,
Bramhall's, Hazard's, and Pettit's batteries,&mdash;twenty-four
guns.</p>

<p>It was past five o'clock before the enemy opened
the battle. An hour passed of constant artillery
firing. Then the Rebels advanced across the wide
and level plain with yellings and howlings.</p>

<p>There was a stream of fire from Sumner's line,&mdash;a
steady outpouring of deadly volleys. It was
twenty thousand against forty thousand. There
were answering volleys from the Rebel lines.
Sumner's batteries left off firing shell and threw
canister, and the lines, which had advanced so
triumphantly, were sent in confusion across the
field. Again they advanced, and were again repulsed.
Longstreet and Jackson, once more under
cover of the gathering darkness, urged on
their reluctant troops. Sumner brought up his
reserve brigades. It was a short, sharp struggle,&mdash;a
wild night-tempest,&mdash;the roaring of fifty cannon,
and thirty thousand muskets. The evening
was unusually calm. Not a breath of air stirred
the leaves of the trees. The stars shone brightly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
Strange the scene,&mdash;so weird and terrible upon
that plain! A thousand men dropped from the
Union ranks, and thrice that number from the
ranks of the Rebels.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked an officer of the Fifth
Vermont, dimly seeing a regiment in the darkness.</p>

<p>There was a momentary silence, and then the
question, "Who are you?"</p>

<p>"The Fifth Vermont."</p>

<p>"Let them have it, boys," were the words of
command shouted by the Rebel officer. The
Vermonters heard it. There was no flinching.
Instantly their rifles came to their cheeks.</p>

<p>There were two broad flashes of light, two
rows of dead and wounded. But the Vermonters
held their ground; and the Rebels, shattered, repulsed,
and utterly defeated, disappeared in the
gloom of night. It was hard for the brave men to
go away from their fallen comrades and leave
them upon the field which they had defended with
their life's blood, but it was impossible to remove
them; and the long lines closed in upon the
wagons, marched down the forest road, and at
daylight were south of White-Oak Swamp.</p>


<h3><a name="Glendale"></a>BATTLE OF GLENDALE.</h3>

<p>"Glendale" is the euphonious name given by
Mr. Nelson to his farm, which is located two miles
south of White-Oak Swamp. It is a place where
several roads meet; from the north, the Swamp
road; from the east, the Long-Bridge road; from
the south, the road leading to Malvern Hill; from
the southwest, the Newmarket road; from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
northwest, the Charles City road, leading to Richmond.
There are farm-houses, groves, ravines,
wheat-fields waving with grain. Upon the Malvern
road, there is a church. West of the church,
a half-mile, is the mansion of Mr. Frazier, where
the Rebel lines were formed on the 30th of June.</p>

<p>At sunrise on that morning, all the divisions
of the Union army were south of the swamp.
Richardson and Smith, with Naglee's brigade, of
Casey's division, were guarding the passage at
the swamp. Slocum was on the Charles City
road, northwest of the church. Kearney was between
that road and the Newmarket road. McCall
was on the Newmarket road, with Hooker
and Sedgwick behind him, nearer the church.</p>

<p>Porter and Keyes were at Malvern with the
trains, two miles distant.</p>

<p>Lee divided his army. Jackson, D.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Hill,
and Ewell followed McClellan down the Swamp
road; while A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;Hill, Longstreet, Huger, Magruder,
and Holmes made all haste down the
Charles City road from Richmond, to strike McClellan
on the flank and divide his army. The
President of the Confederacy went out with A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;Hill to see the Union army cut to pieces.</p>

<p>Jackson reached the bridge across the sluggish
stream in the swamp, but it was torn up; and
on the southern bank stood Smith and Richardson.
Hazard's, Ayres's, and Pettit's batteries
were in position. Jackson brought up all his
guns. There was a fierce artillery fight, lasting
through the day. Jackson succeeded in getting a
small infantry force across towards evening, but
it was not strong enough to make an attack, and
nothing came of all his efforts to harass the rear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>During the afternoon, the pickets on the
Charles City road discovered A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;Hill's troops
filing off from the road, west of Frazier's farm,
toward the south. They went across the fields,
and through the woods to the Newmarket road.
While the main body was thus taking position, a
small body of infantry and a battery opened fire
upon Slocum; but he had cut down the forest in
his front, forming an impassable barrier, so that
he was secure from attack.</p>

<p>General McCall formed his division of six thousand
men, with Meade's brigade, north of the
road, Seymour's south of it, and Reynolds's,&mdash;commanded
in this battle by Colonel Simmons,&mdash;in
reserve. He had five batteries,&mdash;Randall's on
the right, Kerns's and Cooper's in the center, and
Dietrich's and Kanerhun's on the left,&mdash;all in
front of his infantry, looking down a gentle slope
upon an open field; on the west there was a brook,
fringed with a forest growth, with the farm of
Mr. Frazier beyond.</p>

<p>It was half past two before Hill was ready to
make the attack. He threw out two regiments as
skirmishers, which advanced to feel of McCall's
lines; but they were repulsed by the Seventh and
Twelfth Pennsylvania Reserves. Hill had twelve
brigades, six of his own and six of Longstreet's.
Magruder and Huger had not arrived. His plan
was to strike with all his force at once.</p>

<p>Brigade after brigade advanced, but recoiled
before the direct fire of the batteries, sustained by
the infantry.</p>

<p>"The thunder of the cannon, the cracking of
the musketry, from thousands of combatants,
mingled with screams from the wounded and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
dying, were terrific to the ear and to the imagination,"
says a correspondent of the Cologne
Gazette.</p>

<p>"Volleys upon volleys streamed across our

writes a Rebel officer.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>
<p>Five o'clock! The battle has raged two hours
and a half, sustained wholly by McCall, and Hill
has not driven him an inch.</p>

<p>The Rebels desist from their direct attack in
front, and throw all their force upon Seymour's
left, south of the road. McCall sends over the
Fifth and Eighth Regiments from his second line.</p>

<p>"Change front with the infantry and artillery,"
is his order.</p>

<p>Hill is pushing along his left flank to gain his
rear.</p>

<p>McCall orders a charge, and it is executed
with a promptness and vigor sufficient to check
the advancing troops. But his line has become
disordered by the charge. Hill improves the opportunity,
and hurries up his reserve brigades,
which fire while advancing.</p>

<p>The gunners of the German batteries leave
their pieces. McCall rides among them, rallies
them a moment, but the drivers are panic-stricken.
They dash off to the rear, breaking through the
infantry, and trampling down the men. The
Rebels rush upon the deserted guns with unparalleled
frenzy. The line of McCall is broken, and
portions of his troops follow the fleeing cannoneers.</p>

<p>General McCall tries to rally the fugitives, but
they are deaf to all his orders. They stream on
through Hooker's and Sumner's line.</p>

<p>Will Hooker's men join the drifting current?
Now or never they must be brave. Now or never
their country is to be saved. All hearts feel it;
all hands are ready. They stand in the gateway
of centuries. Unnumbered millions are beckoning
them to do their duty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>Hooker has Grover's brigade on the right,
Carr's in the center, and Sickles's on the left,&mdash;just
the order in which they stood at Williamsburg.</p>

<p>The Sixteenth Massachusetts, led by the heroic
Colonel Wyman, met the pursuers. The Sixty-Ninth
Pennsylvania, of Sedgwick's division, joining
upon Hooker's right, delivered at the same
moment a fire upon the flank of the enemy. Along
Sumner's front, from King's, Kirby's, Tompkins's
Owen's, and Bartlett's batteries, flashed double-shotted
guns. It was as if a voice had said,
"Thus far and no farther!" Hooker's infantry
came into close battle-line, delivered a fire, which
forced the Rebels over against Sumner's batteries;
which, in turn, threw them against Kearney,
and against Meade's brigade, which had not
joined in the fight. Grover pushed on with the
First and Sixteenth Massachusetts, the Second
New Hampshire, and Twenty-Sixth Pennsylvania,
with reckless daring. Hill was driven back over
all the ground he had won, with great slaughter.</p>

<p>It was a decided repulse, but costly to the Sixteenth
Massachusetts. Its noble colonel fell at
the head of his regiment. These were the last
words of one of the soldiers of that regiment:
"I thank God that I am permitted to die for my
country, and I thank him yet more that I am
prepared,&mdash;or at least I hope I am."</p>

<p>So complete was the repulse that the Rebel
troops became a mob, and fled in terror towards
Richmond.</p>

<p>"Many old soldiers," says a Rebel officer, "who
had served on the plains of Arkansas and Missouri
wept in the bitterness of their souls like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
children. Of what avail had it been to us that
our best blood had flowed for six long days? Of
what avail all of our unceasing and exhaustless
endurance? Everything seemed lost, and a general
depression came over all our hearts. Batteries
dashed past in headlong flight. Ammunition,
hospital, and supply wagons rushed along,
and swept the troops away with them from the
battle-field. In vain the most frantic exertions,
entreaty, and self-sacrifice of the staff officers!
The troops had lost their foothold, and all was
over with the Southern Confederacy!"<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

<p>General Magruder's arrival alone saved Hill
from an ignominious flight.</p>

<p>Through the night there was the red glare of
torches upon the battle-field where the Rebel
wounded were being gathered up. Great was the
loss. Up to daylight there was no apparent
diminution of the heart-rending cries and groans
of the wounded. A mournful wail was heard
from Glendale during that long, dismal night.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>


<h3><a name="Malvern"></a>THE BATTLE OF MALVERN.</h3>

<p>The battle-field of July 1st, 1862, bears the
pleasant name of Malvern. It is on the north
bank of the James,&mdash;an elevated plain near the
river, but declining gently towards the north,&mdash;divided
into corn and wheat fields, bordered on
the east and west and south by wooded ravines.
The estate is owned by <a name="tn_png_132"></a><!--TN: Period added after "Dr" on Page 131-->Dr. Carter. Although it
bears a name so pleasant, there have been sad
scenes upon those fertile fields,&mdash;not alone the
shock, roar, and horror of a great battle, but
the low wail of mothers for their infants, torn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
from their arms and sold to slave-traders,&mdash;the
agonies of men under torture of the whip, their
flesh torn and mangled by an unfeeling master.</p>

<p>"Was he a good master?" I asked of an old
negro at City Point, in July, 1864.</p>

<p>"No, sir. He was very bad, sir. He was de
wussest dat eber was, sir. He was so bad dat
we call him Hell Carter, sir. 'Cause we tink
dat de Lord will send him to de bad place one ob
dese days, sir. He go dere sure, sir."</p>

<p>The mansion is a quaint old structure, built of
red bricks, surrounded by elms, and commanding
a wide panorama of the James, of the valley of
the Appomattox, and the distant Richmond hills.</p>

<p>The house was standing in the time of the Revolution,
and was marked on the map of Cornwallis.</p>

<p>West of Malvern are the Strawberry Plains.
A streamlet, which rises in the vicinity of Glendale,
courses to the James through a wooded
ravine between the Strawberry grounds and Malvern.
The hill is so sharp and steep and high
that General Barnard was able to plant two tiers
of guns upon the slope, and crown it with heavy
siege guns. The trees in the ravine were felled,
and rifle-pits thrown up, extending along the
western side and across the open field towards
the north, where the slope of the hill shades into
the level plain.</p>

<p>Eastward, the trees were felled and their
branches lopped by the pioneers. It was a strong
position, and these preparations made it impregnable.
Lee must assail it from the northwest,&mdash;over
the wide plain, exposed to the fire of sixty
cannon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>Porter's corps occupied the ravine between Malvern
and the Plains. Couch's, Kearney's, and
Hooker's divisions held the front towards the
north. Sumner's and Franklin's corps held the
left; the Pennsylvania Reserves and the remainder
of Keyes's corps, the center. The line was
semicircular, and so well concentrated were the
troops, that reinforcements, if needed, might be
had with little delay.</p>

<p>In the James River, two miles distant, lay a
fleet of five gunboats, carrying heavy guns,&mdash;near
enough to throw shells upon the Strawberry
Plains.</p>

<p>The Rebels advanced cautiously. Jackson,
Ewell, Whiting, and D.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Hill moved down the
Quaker road, while Magruder, Longstreet, Huger,
and Holmes came down the Richmond road.
Jackson, D.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Hill, and Ewell appeared in front
of Couch; Huger and Magruder, in front of Morell's
division of Porter's corps; while Holmes
filed through the woods towards the James, along
the western edge of Strawberry Plains.</p>

<p>Although the distance from Glendale is but
two and a half miles, it was past ten o'clock before
the head of Magruder's columns appeared in
sight. A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;Hill's division, which had been so
terribly shattered at Glendale, was left behind.</p>

<p>Magruder shelled the woods and advanced cautiously.
There was a pattering skirmish fire
through the forenoon, with an artillery duel at
long range.</p>

<p>Noon passed, and there was no apparent disposition
on the part of the Rebels to make an attack.
They dreaded the terrible fire from the numerous
guns gleaming in the sun upon the hillside.</p>

<p>General Magruder brought all of the cannon
into position which could be advantageously
posted, and at two o'clock opened a rapid fire,
which was replied to by the batteries on the hill.
He threw forward his skirmishers at an earlier
hour.</p>

<p>Jackson moved forward a division upon Couch
an hour later, but it was hurled back in confusion
by the fire of the batteries, and the deadly volley
delivered from the rifle-pits.</p>

<p>Holmes, all the while, had been edging towards
the river, to gain the rear of McClellan, but the
enormous shells from the gunboats, which tore
down the forests, paralyzed his soldiers.</p>

<p>There was a consultation among the Rebel
commanders. Lee had intrusted the command in
his center to Magruder. His brigadier-generals
did not want to advance over the plain.</p>

<p>"I am unwilling to slaughter my brigade,"
said General Cobb, "but, if you command me, I
shall make the charge if my last man falls."</p>

<p>"I intend to make the charge, no matter what
it costs," said Magruder.</p>

<p>The commanders went to their brigades, murmuring
that Magruder was drunk, that it would
be madness to make the attack.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p>Magruder formed his line in the woods. Armistead's
brigade moved upon the Union picket line
and drove it back. "Advance rapidly, press forward
your whole line, and follow up Armistead's
successes. They are reported to be getting off,"
was Lee's message to Magruder.</p>

<p>It was past six o'clock before Mahone, Ransom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
Wright, Jones, and Cobb were ready. At the
word of command, fifteen thousand men move
from the shelter of the woods and appear upon
the open plain, moving in solid phalanx,&mdash;close,
compact, shoulder to shoulder, to capture, by a
desperate charge, the batteries upon the hillside.
It is madness! Success has made them reckless.</p>

<p>With shoutings and howlings they break into a
run. Instantly the hill is all aflame, from base
to summit. Shells, shrapnel, and canister are
poured upon them. There is the bellowing of a
hundred cannon, mingled with the <a name="tn_png_137"></a><!--TN: "mutitudinous" changed to "multitudinous" on Page 136-->multitudinous
rattling of thousands of small arms.</p>

<p>The Rebel lines melt away,&mdash;whole squadrons
tumbling headlong. In vain the effort, the men
waver, turn, and disappear within the woods.</p>

<p>Magruder is furious at the failure. Again the
attempt,&mdash;again the same result.</p>

<p>The sun is going down behind the hills when
he makes his last effort. Meagher and Sickles
go up from the right, and strengthen Porter's
center. There is a shifting of batteries,&mdash;a movement
to new positions,&mdash;a re-arranging of regiments.
The artillery on both sides, and the gunboats,
keep up a constant fire.</p>

<p>The Rebels advance, but they are not able to
reach the base of the hill. "From sixteen batteries,"
says the chaplain of the Fourth Texas, "and
from their gunboats they beclouded the day and
lit the night with a lurid glare. Add to this
the light and noise of our own artillery, which
had been brought forward, and, like an opposing
volcano with a hundred craters, it gleamed, and
flashed streams and sheets of fire,&mdash;while long
lines of human forms cast their shadows upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
darkness in the background, and each joined with
his firelock in hand to contribute to the terrors
of the awful scene."<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

<p>Officers and men, in this contest, go down in
one indiscriminate slaughter. They are whirled
into the air, torn, mangled, blown into fragments.
They struggle against the merciless storm, break,
and disappear in the darkness, panting, exhausted,
foiled, dispirited, demoralized, refusing
to be murdered, and uttering execrations upon
the drunken Magruder.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></p>

<p>Although the army was upon James River, and
in communication with the gunboats, and although
the Rebels had been repulsed mainly by the artillery,
orders were issued by General McClellan to
retreat to Harrison's Landing. At midnight the
troops were on the march, stealing noiselessly
away, abandoning the wounded.</p>

<p>"Although," says General McClellan, "the result
of the battle of Malvern was a complete victory,
it was necessary to fall back still farther,
in order to reach a point where our supplies could
be brought to us with certainty."<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p>There were some officers who were much amazed
at this order. They felt that having reached the
river and defeated the enemy with terrible slaughter
there should be no more falling back.</p>

<p>"It is one of the strangest things in this week
of disaster," says Chaplain Marks, "that General
McClellan ordered a retreat to Harrison's Landing,
six miles down James River, after we had
gained so decided a victory. When the order
was received by the impatient and eager army,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
consternation and amazement overwhelmed our
patriotic and ardent hosts. Some refused to obey
the command. General Martindale shed tears of
shame. The brave and chivalrous Kearny said in
the presence of many officers, <a name="tn_png_139"></a><!--TN: Double quote changed to a single quote before "I" on Page 138-->'I, Philip Kearny,

order can only be prompted by cowardice or <a name="tn_png_139a"></a><!--TN: Single quote added after "treason." on Page 138-->treason.'"<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<h3>AFFAIRS IN FRONT OF WASHINGTON.</h3>


<p><span class="firstwords">The</span> prospects of the Rebels, which were so
gloomy in April, were bright once more. They
had driven the Army of the Potomac away from
Richmond. It was August. A month had passed
and General McClellan had shown no disposition
to advance again upon Richmond. A consultation
was held in that city. President Davis said
that the time had come to strike a great blow.
General Pope was in front of Washington with
forty thousand men. It was determined to crush
him, invade Maryland, and capture Baltimore and
Washington. The Southern newspapers hinted
that Tennessee, Kentucky, and the whole of Virginia
were to be recovered, that Maryland was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
to be liberated from oppression, Philadelphia,
Pittsburg, and Cincinnati assailed.</p>

<p>General Lee's army numbered not far from
one hundred thousand, having been reinforced by
troops from the South. Those troops who had
fought Burnside in North Carolina were hurried
up; others were sent from South Carolina,
Florida, and Georgia. Conscription was enforced
vigorously. General Lee proposed to leave a force
in Richmond large enough to hold it against McClellan,
while he sent the main body of the army
to fall like a thunderbolt on General Pope.</p>

<p>These preparations were known in Washington,
and on the 3d of August General Halleck, who
had been placed in command of all the troops in
the field, telegraphed to General McClellan to
send his army to Aquia Creek as soon as possible.
General Burnside's troops were withdrawn from
Fortress Monroe, and united to Pope's army.</p>

<p>General McClellan wished to remain upon the
James and attack Richmond from that quarter,
but General Halleck felt that it was absolutely
necessary to unite the two armies. "You must
move with all possible celerity," was the telegram
sent on the 9th of August.</p>

<p>But it was not till the 16th that the army broke
up its camp and moved down the Peninsula, to
Yorktown.</p>

<p>While that despatch of the 9th was on the
wires, Jackson, D.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Hill, Ewell, and Winder
were engaged with Pope on the Rapidan.</p>

<p>General Pope had advanced from the Rappahannock,
to hold the enemy in check till the
Army of the Potomac could be brought back
from the Peninsula.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>


<h3><a name="Cedar"></a>BATTLE OF CEDAR MOUNTAIN.</h3>

<p>Fertile and fair are the farms of Culpepper, as
beautiful as any in the Old Dominion. They are
watered by swiftly running streams. Their slopes
are verdant and sunny, sheltered by the Blue
Ridge from wintry blasts. Beyond the town of
Culpepper, towards the south, there is a hillock,
called Cedar Mountain, which rises abruptly,
and in shape like a sugar-loaf. Near the Mountain
is the house of Rev. Mr. Slaughter. Robinson's
Creek winds through his farm, south of the
Mountain, on its course to the Rapidan. North
of the Mountain is the residence of Mrs. Crittenden.
The house is shaded by overhanging trees.
It stands on the west side of the highway leading
from Culpepper to Madison. Standing there and
looking towards the Mountain, we see fields of
corn and wheat, groves and woods, bordering the
field.</p>

<p>General Crawford's brigade of Banks's corps, in
the advance from Culpepper to the Rapidan, on
the 8th of August, encountered Jackson's pickets
at the base of the Mountain, upon the farm of Mr.
Slaughter.</p>

<p>On Saturday morning, the 9th instant, General
Williams's division joined Crawford. As the
troops approached the farm of Mrs. Crittenden,
the base and summit of the Mountain seemingly
became volcanic. There was an outburst of flame
and smoke, a screaming in the air, and the deep
reverberation of the cannonade.</p>

<p>Williams's batteries were soon in position, and
replied with shot and shells.</p>

<p>General Banks arrived. He formed a line of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
battle, placing Williams's division west of the
Madison road, near Mrs. Crittenden's house, and
Augur's division east of it, nearer the Mountain.
On the right of the line west of the house was
Gordon's brigade, next Crawford, Geary, Greene,
and Prince.</p>

<p>Jackson, from his lookout on the Mountain,
could see all the movements of General Banks.
He threw out a line of skirmishers. Banks did
the same. They met midway the armies, and
began the contest. An hour passed of rapid artillery
firing. Then the infantry became engaged,
Jackson throwing his brigades upon Prince, turning
his flank, and pushing him back. At the same
time there was a furious attack upon Crawford.
His men stood it awhile, then charged the Rebel
lines, but were repulsed. Gordon moved in to
take his place. The left of the line, Prince and
Geary and Greene, was swinging back. Jackson
was moving fresh brigades upon the center, but
Gordon held them in check. His men dropped
rapidly, but so destructive were his volleys that
the Rebel line wavered and then retreated. But
other brigades were thrown upon Gordon's right
flank. They swept him with an enfilading fire,
and he, too, was compelled to retreat or be cut off.
He retired past Mrs. Crittenden's, across Cedar
Creek. There Banks formed again, planted his
artillery, and waited the advance of the enemy.</p>

<p>Ricketts's division came up from McDowell's
corps, ready to receive Jackson, but the Rebel
general was content with what he had already
accomplished.</p>

<p>During the night there was an artillery duel,
and a skirmish among the pickets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>In the morning, a white flag was displayed on
the field, and the wounded were gathered, and
the dead buried. Officers from both armies met
and conversed freely of the war. General Hartsuff,
and the Rebel General Stuart, who were old
acquaintances, shook hands upon the ground
where the contest had been so fierce.</p>

<p>General Jackson withdrew his forces after the
battle towards Gordonsville, to wait the advance
of the main army, under Lee, while General Pope
pushed south to the Rapidan.</p>

<p>On the 16th, General Pope's cavalry captured
a Rebel courier, who was bearing a letter from
Lee to Jackson, from which it was ascertained
that the whole of Lee's army was moving north
from Richmond, to crush Pope before McClellan
could join him. General Pope was prompt to
act upon this information. He retreated to the
north bank of the Rappahannock, planted his
artillery to cover the fords, hoping to hold Lee in
check till he was reinforced.</p>

<p>Lee followed rapidly with his whole army. He
reached the Rappahannock on the 21st, attempted
to cross, but was foiled in all his movements.</p>

<p>Suddenly, on the night of the 22d, General
Stuart fell upon the Orange and Alexandria Railroad
at Catlett's Station, in General Pope's rear.
It was a dark, rainy night. Many army wagons
were there, and some were burned. All the horses
were taken. General Pope lost his personal baggage.</p>

<p>In the morning, General Pope understood that
it was Lee's intention to gain his rear, and cut
him off from Washington. Jackson was moving
along the base of the Blue Ridge by swift marches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>The mountains, which at Leesburg are called
the Catoctin Range, farther south are called the
Bull Run Mountains. There is a gap at Aldie,
and another one at the head of Broad Run, called
Thoroughfare Gap. There the mountain is cut
down sharp and square. There is room for the
railroad, the turnpike, and the creek. A hundred
men might hold it against a thousand. That part
of the mountain south of the gap is about ten
miles long.</p>

<p>One day I climbed the ridge to take a look at
the surrounding country. Northward I could
see the gap. A mile or two east of it, on the
Manassas Gap Railroad, was the little village of
Gainsville. Directly east was the cluster of
houses called Greenwich, on the Warrenton and
Centreville Turnpike. Ten miles distant, a little
south of east, was Manassas Junction. Bristow's
Station is south; Catlett's, southwest. Warrenton,
one of the prettiest towns in Virginia, lies at
the foot of the mountain, southwest, with roads
radiating in all directions, as if it were the body
of a spider, and the highways were legs. Westward
is the Blue Ridge, looming dark and high,
like an ocean billow ready to break over all the
surrounding plains. In the northwest are the
Cobble Mountains,&mdash;hillocks which lie between
Bull Run and the Blue Ridge. Upon the railroad
which winds towards Manassas Gap is the
town of Salem.</p>

<p>If I had stood there on the 26th of August, I
should have seen a body of Rebel troops moving
across from the base of the Blue Ridge, through
fields, through forests, and along the highways,
towards Salem with great rapidity,&mdash;the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
footsore, weary,&mdash;many of them barefoot, few of
them decently dressed,&mdash;but urged on by their
officers. It is Jackson's corps pushing for Thoroughfare
Gap.</p>

<p>At Warrenton, General McDowell is breaking
camp, and moving east over the Centreville turnpike
to reach Gainsville. General Sigel follows
him. General Reno, with Burnside's troops, is
marching for Greenwich. General Kearny's and
General Hooker's men, who have fought at Williamsburg,
Seven Pines, Glendale, and Malvern,
have joined Pope, and are moving along the
Orange and Alexandria Railroad. General
Porter is at Warrenton Junction. General Banks
is coming up near the Rappahannock to join
Porter.</p>

<p>On the 26th, General Ewell's division, having
passed through Thoroughfare Gap, fell upon
Manassas Junction, burnt the depot, an immense
amount of stores, a railroad train, and the bridge
across Bull Run.</p>

<p>General Taylor's brigade, of Franklin's corps,
reached the spot, but were obliged to fall back
towards Fairfax, their commander mortally
wounded.</p>

<p>Lee was following Pope. He hoped to crush
him,&mdash;to grind him to powder between his own
and Jackson's force then in Pope's rear.</p>

<p>West of Manassas Junction is Kettle Run.
General Ewell formed his line on the eastern
bank, and waited Pope's advance. Hooker fell
upon him on the afternoon of the 27th, and defeated
him. Ewell fell back upon Jackson and
A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;Hill.</p>

<p>Hooker was out of ammunition. Pope ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
Porter to join him, but he did not obey the
order.</p>

<p>Jackson was in a dangerous place. He was
not strong enough to advance and give battle to
Pope, who was now pressing him. He must retreat
and gain time,&mdash;delay an engagement till
Lee could come up. He fell back before Pope
from Manassas to Centreville, then turned west
over the Warrenton turnpike, along which McDowell's
army marched in the first battle of Bull
Run, the 21st of July, 1861.</p>

<p>At this moment McDowell was moving east on
the same turnpike.</p>

<p>At six o'clock King's division of McDowell's
corps, which was in advance, came in collision
with Jackson at Groveton, on the western edge
of the old battle-field. Gibbon's and Doubleday's
brigades were engaged a short time, but darkness
put an end to the conflict.</p>

<p>Pope, with Hooker, Kearny, and Reno, had
reached Centreville; Porter was at Manassas
Junction; Banks, south of it; while Sigel and
McDowell were southwest of Jackson, towards
Warrenton. Jackson was in danger of being
crushed. Pope, instead of being ground to powder,
had maneuvered so admirably that he felt
almost sure that Jackson would be utterly routed.</p>

<p>He lost no time in sending out orders. "Hold
your ground at all hazards," was his despatch to
General King. "Push on at one o'clock to-night,"
was the word sent to Kearny, who was to move
west over Warrenton turnpike and attack Jackson's
rear. "Assault vigorously at daylight," he
added, "for Hooker and Reno will be on hand to
help you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>"Move on Centreville at the earliest dawn,"
was the order sent to Porter at Manassas.</p>

<p>General Pope was sure that he could crumble
Jackson before Longstreet, who, he knew, was
rapidly advancing towards Thoroughfare Gap,
could arrive. Ricketts's division was thrown
north, to hold the gap.</p>

<p>But General King's troops were exhausted. Instead
of holding the ground, he fell back towards
the junction.</p>

<p>General Ricketts sent a small force up to the
gap, but Longstreet, who had reached Salem,
sent a part of his troops over the mountains north,
gained their rear, forced them back, and thus
opened the gate for the advance of his corps.
Ricketts joined McDowell at the junction.</p>

<p>All this made it necessary for General Pope to
issue new orders. He sent out his aides.</p>

<p>"Attack at once," was the word to Sigel.</p>

<p>"Push down the turnpike, as soon as possible,
towards any heavy firing you may hear," was the
despatch to Kearny and Hooker, also to Reno,
commanding a division of Burnside's corps.</p>

<p>"Be on the field at daybreak," was the message
to Porter.</p>

<p>"Send your train to Manassas and Centreville.
Repair the railroad to Bull Run. Work night and
day," were the instructions to Banks, who was
guarding the trains.</p>

<p>It was of the utmost importance that the attack
should be made instantly, before Longstreet arrived;
and to that end General Pope directed all
his energies.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<h3>BATTLE OF GROVETON.</h3>


<p><span class="firstwords">The</span> morning of the 29th dawned calm, clear,
and beautiful. Sigel obeyed orders. He was on
the northwest corner of the old battle-field, near
Dogan's house. Jackson was north of the turnpike,
his right resting on Bull Run, at Sudley
Springs, and his left on the turnpike near Groveton,
along the line of an unfinished railway.</p>

<p>Schurz was on the right in Sigel's corps, Milroy
in the center, Schenck on the left, with Steinwehr
in reserve. For an hour there was the
deep roll of artillery.</p>

<p>Then the line advanced. There was a sharp
contest,&mdash;Sigel occupying the ground which Jackson
held in the first fight on that memorable field,
and Jackson upon the ground, where Burnside,
Howard, and Hunter formed their lines. Milroy
was driven, but Schurz and Schenck held their
position. Hooker and Kearny were astir at daylight.
They crossed the stream at the Stone
Bridge, swung out into the fields, and moved north
towards Sudley Springs, forcing Jackson back on
Longstreet, who was resting after his hard march,
his men eating a hearty meal from the stores captured
at Manassas. He was in no condition to
fight at that early hour.</p>

<p>Time slipped away&mdash;precious hours! McDowell
had not come. Porter had not been heard
from. "Longstreet is getting ready," was the
report from the scouts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>Noon passed. One o'clock came round. "Longstreet
is joining Jackson," was the word from the
pickets. The attack must be made at once if ever.</p>

<p>It began at two o'clock by Hooker and Kearny
on the right, pushing through the woods and
across the fields between Dogan's house and Sudley
Church.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></p>

<p>The veterans of the Peninsula move upon an
enemy whom they have met before. Jackson
has made the line of a half-finished railroad his
defense, and his men are behind the embankments
and in the excavations. It is a long, desperate
conflict. There are charges upon the enemy's
lines and repulses. Three,&mdash;four,&mdash;five o'clock,
and Porter has not come. McDowell, who should
have marched northwest to Groveton to meet
Longstreet, has, through some mistake, marched
east of that place, and joined the line where
Kearny and Hooker are driving Jackson.</p>

<p>At this hour, sunset, on August 29th, Kearny,
Hooker, and Reno are pushing west, north of the
turnpike, close upon the heels of Jackson. King's
division of McDowell's corps is moving west along
the turnpike past Dogan's house, to attack what
has been Jackson's right center, but which is now
the left center of the united forces of Jackson and
Longstreet. Sigel's brigades have been shattered,
and are merely holding their ground south of the
turnpike. O, if Porter with his twelve thousand
fresh troops was only there to fall on Jackson's
right flank! But he is not in sight. Nothing
has been heard from him. He has had all day to
march five miles over an unobstructed road. He
has had his imperative orders,&mdash;has heard the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
roar of battle. He is an officer in the Regular
service, and knows that it is the first requisite of
an officer or a soldier to obey orders.</p>

<p>Longstreet is too late upon the ground to make
an attack with his whole force. The sun goes
down and darkness comes on. The contest for
the day is over. Jackson has been driven on
his right, and Heintzelman's corps holds the
ground. Both armies sleep on their arms.</p>

<p>The auspicious moment for crushing Jackson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
had passed. The most that Pope could hope for
was to hold his ground till Franklin and Sumner,
who had landed at Alexandria, could join him.
Thus far the battle had been in his favor. He
wished to save his wagons which were at Manassas.
If he retreated across Bull Run and made
that his line of defense, he must abandon his
trains at Manassas. If he did this, Banks
would be cut off. He hoped, with Porter's
magnificent corps holding his left flank, to defeat
Lee.</p>

<p>The morning of the 30th dawned. The pickets
of the two armies were within a hundred
yards of each other. The air was calm, the sky
clear, and the morning as bright and beautiful as
that Sabbath when the first great battle of the
war was fought.</p>

<p>The Rebel line was crescent-shaped. Its left
under Jackson reached from Sudley Springs to a
point near the turnpike, about a mile and a half
west of Groveton. Longstreet commanded the
right wing, which extended from Jackson's command
far to the southwest, stretching beyond the
Manassas Gap Railroad.</p>

<p>This point was the center of the Rebel line.
It was a high knoll or ridge of land which commanded
two thirds of Lee's front. Here were
forty-eight pieces of artillery. It was a very
strong position. From this knoll eastward, the
Rebel artillerymen looked down a long slope
broken by undulations, the ground partitioned
by fences, dividing it into fields, pastures, and
wooded hills and hollows.</p>

<p>Pope had about forty thousand men, who stood
face to face with the army which had driven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
McClellan from the Chickahominy, and which
met him a few days later at Antietam.</p>

<p>The troops which had come from the Army
of the Potomac were worn and dispirited. Hooker's
and Kearny's divisions had been in nearly
all the battles of the Peninsula. Almost alone
they had fought the battle of Williamsburg.
They were at Seven Pines, in skirmish after
skirmish on the Chickahominy, and at Glendale
and Malvern. Hooker on this morning of the
30th had but two thousand four hundred and
forty-one men&mdash;so sadly had disease and battle
thinned the ranks.</p>

<p>Porter came up tardily. He had twelve thousand
men, but they did not like General Pope.
They believed that General McClellan had been
cruelly sacrificed by the government. There was
no hearty co-operation by the officers of Porter's
command with General Pope. Griffin's and
Piatt's brigades took the road to Centreville,
either by mistake or otherwise, and were not in
the battle.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> Instead of twelve thousand, Porter
brought but seven thousand to the field. Sigel's
troops were mainly Germans, wanting in discipline,
vigor, energy, and endurance. Pope's
army was a conglomeration, wanting coherence.
He had, besides the troops from the Army of the
Potomac, McDowell's, who had been an army by
themselves; Sigel's, who had served under Fremont,
whom they idolized; Reno's, who looked
upon Burnside as the only commander who had
achieved victories. General Pope was from the
West. He was unacquainted with his troops,
and they with him. He had issued an order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
<a name="tn_png_153"></a><!--TN: "ermitting" changed to "permitting" on Page 152-->permitting them to forage at will, which had
produced laxity of discipline and demoralization.
Yet with all these things against him, he felt it to
be his duty to offer battle to Lee.</p>

<p>Porter arrived with his seven thousand about
nine o'clock, more than twenty-four hours late.
He came into position in front of Sigel on the
turnpike. Pope's line was thus complete. Hooker
on the right at Sudley; Kearny and Reno
next reaching to the turnpike; Porter next,
with Sigel in rear; and McDowell commanding
Reynolds's, King's, and Ricketts's divisions on
the left, near the ground where the Rebels made
their last stand in the first battle of Manassas.</p>

<p>Had General Pope awaited an attack, the battle
might have had a different ending, but his
provisions were exhausted, and he could not wait.
He must fight at once and win a victory or retreat.</p>

<p>He had sent to Alexandria for provisions.
General McClellan was there. The Army of the
Potomac, when it arrived there, was in the department
commanded by General Pope, and was
therefore subject to his orders, which left McClellan
without a command. Franklin and Sumner,
with thirty thousand men, were moving out and
could guard the trains. At daylight, while General
Pope was forming his lines, endeavoring to
hold at bay the army before which McClellan
had retired from the Chickahominy, Savage Station,
Glendale, and Malvern, General McClellan
informed General Pope that the supplies would
be loaded into cars and wagons as soon as Pope
would send in a cavalry escort, to guard the
trains!</p>

<p>"Such a letter," says General Pope, "when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
we were fighting the enemy, and Alexandria
swarming with troops, needs no comment. Bad
as was the situation of the cavalry, I was in no
situation to spare troops from the front, nor
could they have gone to Alexandria and returned
within a time by which we must have
had provisions or have fallen back in the direction
of Washington. Nor do I see what service cavalry
could give in guarding railroad trains. It was
not till I received this letter, that I began to feel
discouraged and nearly hopeless of any <a name="tn_png_154"></a><!--TN: "sucessful" changed to "successful" on Page 153-->successful
issue to the operations with which I was
charged."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></p>

<p>The battle at that moment was beginning; the
reveille of the cannonade at that early hour was
waking thousands to engage in their last day's
work in the service of their country. Through
the forenoon there was a lively picket firing, accompanying
an artillery duel.</p>

<p>"The enemy is making a movement to turn
our left," was Sigel's message to Pope a little past
noon. Lee's division, as they passed down from
Thoroughfare Gap, marched towards Manassas
Junction, and came into line beyond McDowell.</p>

<p>General Reynolds, who was south of the turnpike,
advanced to feel of Longstreet's position.
He found the enemy sheltered in the woods.
The musketry began. Porter, southwest of Dogan's
house, moved into the forest, where the
battle had raged the night before. He was received
with sharp volleys. His men fought but
a short time and retreated.</p>

<p>"Why are you retreating so soon?" General
Sigel asked of the men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>"We are out of ammunition."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></p>

<p>They passed on to Sigel's rear.</p>

<p>Suddenly there were thundering volleys on the
left. Lee was attacking with great vigor. At
the same moment, Hooker, Kearny, and Reno
were driving Jackson towards Sudley, swinging
him back from his advanced position.</p>

<p>The battle line was swinging like a gate pivoted
on its center. The Rebels followed Porter,
cheering and shouting. Grover's brigade of
Hooker's division, which had been facing west,
changed its line of march to the south, came
down past Dogan's house, to the line of unfinished
railroad which Lee had taken for his defense.</p>

<p>Milroy's brigade of Sigel's corps was lying in
the road which leads from Groveton towards the
south.</p>

<p>The Rebels were advancing upon him. Schurz,
who was still farther south, was retiring before
the mass of Rebel troops, who came within reach
of Milroy's guns, which thinned their ranks at
every discharge. But the Rebels were on Milroy's
left flank, which was bending like a bruised
reed before their advance. Grover came down
with those men who had never failed to do their
whole duty.</p>

<p>"We stood in three lines," said a wounded
Rebel officer to me at Warrington, two months
after the battle. "They fell upon us like a thunderbolt.
They paid no attention to our volleys.
We mowed them down, but they went right
through our first line, through our second, and
advanced to the railroad embankment, and there
we stopped them. They did it so splendidly that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
we couldn't help cheering them. It made me
feel bad to fire on such brave fellows."</p>

<p>They had charged into the thickest of the enemy's
columns, but could not hold the position,
and were forced back.</p>

<p>Lee formed his lines for the decisive onset.
Making the point on the turnpike, where Longstreet's
command joined Jackson's, he swung his
right against McDowell, Sigel, and Porter.</p>

<p>Hood was on the left of the charging column,
nearest the turnpike; then Pickett, Jenkins,
Toombs, and Kemper. Evans and Anderson were
in reserve.</p>

<p>It was impossible to withstand this force; yet
it was a furious, obstinate, bloody fight.</p>

<p>"It had been a task of almost superhuman
labor," writes Pollard, the Southern historian,
"to drive the enemy from his strong points, defended
as they were by the best artillery and
infantry in the Federal army, but in less than
four hours from the commencement of the battle,
our indomitable energy had accomplished everything.
The arrival of Anderson with his reserves,
proved a timely acquisition, and the handsome
manner in which he brought his troops into position
showed the cool and skilful general. Our
generals, Lee, Longstreet, Hood, Kemper, Evans,
Jones, Jenkins, and others, all shared the dangers
to which they exposed their men."<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>

<p>Night put an end to the conflict. When darkness
came on, Lee found that he was still confronted
by men in line, with cannon well posted
on the eminences towards Stone Bridge. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
gained the battle-ground, but had not routed the
Union army.</p>

<p>The retreat was conducted in good order across
Bull Run. General Stahl's brigade was the last
to cross Stone Bridge, which was accomplished at
midnight, without molestation from Lee, who was
too much exhausted to make the attempt to rout
the forty thousand men, who had resisted the
attack of all his troops,&mdash;the same army which
had compelled General McClellan, commanding
an army of a hundred thousand, to move from the
Chickahominy to the James.</p>

<p>General Pope states his own force to have been
not over forty thousand. If the whole of Porter's
corps had been engaged, and if Banks had been
available, he would have had about fifty thousand
men. The force against him numbered not less
than eighty thousand. In the subsequent battle
of Antietam, Lee had the same army which fought
this battle, estimated by General McClellan to
number ninety-seven thousand men,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> with the exception
of those lost him at South Mountain and
Harper's Ferry.</p>

<p>The battle of Groveton was therefore one of
the most bravely fought and obstinate contests of
the war,&mdash;fought by General Pope under adverse
circumstances,&mdash;great inferiority of numbers,
with a subordinate commander who disobeyed
orders; with other officers who manifested no
hearty co-operation. It will be for the future
historian to do full justice to the brave men who
made so noble a fight, who, had they been supported
as they should have been, would doubtless
have won a glorious victory.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>


<h3><a name="Retreat"></a>THE RETREAT TO WASHINGTON.</h3>

<p>General Sumner and General Franklin joined
General Pope at Centreville. But the army was
disorganized. The defeat, the want of co-operation
on the part of some of the officers of the
Army of the Potomac, had a demoralizing influence.</p>

<p>General McClellan was at Alexandria. On the
29th, while Pope was trying to crush Jackson
before the arrival of Longstreet, waiting anxiously
for the appearance of Porter, who had disobeyed
the order given him, the President, solicitous
to hear from the army, inquired by telegram
of him: "What's the news from Manassas?"</p>

<p>"Stragglers report," was the reply, "that the
enemy are evacuating Centreville, and retiring
through Thoroughfare Gap. I am clear that one
of two courses should be adopted: first, to concentrate
all our available force, to open communication
with Pope; second, to leave Pope to get out
of his scrape, and at once use all our means to
make the capital safe."<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></p>

<p>General Pope had opened his communications
unaided by General McClellan. He had moved to
the Rapidan, to enable General McClellan to withdraw
from the Peninsula; had held his ground till
the Rebel cavalry cut the railroad at Manassas;
then with great rapidity he had moved to crush
Jackson, and had failed only through the deliberate
disobedience of orders by General Porter.</p>

<p>Lee, on the second day after the battle of Groveton,
made another flank movement north of
Centreville, to cut off the Union army from Wash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>ington.
There was a fight at Chantilly, where the
brave and impetuous Kearny was killed, and the
enemy fell back behind the intrenchments in
front of Washington, and passed from the hands
of General Pope into the hands of General McClellan.</p>

<p>It will be for the future historian to determine
the measure of blame or praise upon him,&mdash;the
causes of disaster to the Army of the Potomac on
the Peninsula, and to the Army of Virginia at
Manassas. A military tribunal, composed of the
peers of General Porter, has pronounced its verdict
upon him. He has been cashiered,&mdash;lost his
place and his good name forever.</p>

<H3>INVASION OF MARYLAND.</h3>


<p>"<span class="firstwords">We</span> are going to liberate Maryland," said a
Rebel officer to a friend of mine who was taken
prisoner at Catlett's Station. Throughout the
South it was believed that the people of Maryland
were down-trodden and oppressed, that the
soldiers of President Lincoln prevented them
from expressing their sympathy with the rebellion.
In every Southern home and in the Rebel
army, there was one song more popular than all
others, entitled "Maryland."</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>General Lee had no intention of attacking
Washington. It was his plan to raise the standard
of revolt in Maryland, bring about a second
uprising of the people of Baltimore, and transfer
the war to the North. He issued strict orders
that all private property in Maryland should be
respected, that everything should be paid for.</p>

<p>On the 5th of September, he crossed the Potomac
at Noland's Ford, near Point of Rocks.
Jackson led the column. When he reached the
middle of the stream he halted his men, pulled
off his cap, while the bands struck up "My Mary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>land,"
which was sung by the whole army with
great enthusiasm.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></p>

<p>Lee moved towards Frederick, a quiet old town,
between the mountains and the Monocacy. It was
the harvest season. The orchards were loaded
with fruit; the barns were filled with hay; the
granaries with wheat; and there were thousands
of acres of corn rustling in the autumn winds.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock on the morning of the 6th, General
Stuart's cavalry entered the city. There
were some Marylanders in the Rebel army, who
were warmly welcomed by their friends. A few
ladies waved their handkerchiefs, but the majority
of the people of the city had made up their minds
to stand by the old flag, and manifested no demonstrations
of joy. Many of them, however, took
down the stars and stripes, when they saw the
Rebels advancing; but over one house it waved
proudly in the morning breeze, as General Jackson
rode into town. His soldiers dashed forward
to tear it down.</p>

<p>What followed has been beautifully told by
Whittier.</p>

<p>General Lee had a plan to execute other than
the liberation of Maryland,&mdash;the invasion of
Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>"We treat the people of Maryland well, for
they are our brothers, but we intend to make the
North howl," one of the officers said.</p>

<p>"Lee will cut his way to Philadelphia, and dictate
terms of peace in Independence Square. He
will stand with torch in hand and demand Maryland,
Virginia, Kentucky, and Missouri, and
peace, or he will lay that city in ashes," said another.</p>

<p>But before he could venture on an invasion of
Pennsylvania he must have an open communication
with Richmond. There were eleven thousand
men under Colonel Mills at Harper's Ferry,
who were strongly fortified. It would not do to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
leave them in his rear. If that place were captured
he could move north.</p>

<p>The geographical features of the country were
favorable to the execution of his plans.</p>

<p>Ten miles west of Frederick the South Mountain
rises above the surrounding country, dark,
steep, rocky, and clothed with forests. Its most
northern spur is near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.
There are two gaps in the range west of Frederick.
If Lee could hold these with a portion of
his force, he could surround Harper's Ferry, situated
on the Potomac, where that winding and impetuous
river leaps through the rocky gorge.</p>

<p>If successful in capturing it, he could still hold
the mountain gates, and pour the great bulk of
his army north through the rich Cumberland valley.
If McClellan was held at bay in his efforts
to take the passes, and should move north, and
come down the valley, then, pointing his guns in
the passes westward upon McClellan, Lee could
spring like a tiger on Baltimore and Washington.</p>

<p>The first thing to be done after resting his army
was to seize Harper's Ferry.</p>

<p>The people of Frederick and the farmers round
the city had a chance to sell all their goods,&mdash;their
boots, shoes, clothes, flour, bacon, pigs, cattle,
and horses, but they were paid in Confederate
money, which was worth so many rags.</p>

<p>Lee's army was very dirty and filthy. It had
made hard marches. The men had no tents.
They had slept on the ground, had lived some of
the time on green corn and apples, had fought
battles, had been for weeks exposed to storms,
sunshine, rain, mud, and dust, with no change of
clothing. They had thrown all their strength into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
this one grand invasion of the North, and had
shown a wonderful vigor. The rest and repose,
the good living which they found, were very acceptable.
They obeyed General Lee's orders, and
behaved well.</p>

<p>General Lee issued an address to the people of
Maryland.</p>

<p>"The people of the South have seen with profound
indignation their sister State deprived of
every right and reduced to the condition of a
conquered province.</p>

<p>"Believing that the people of Maryland possessed
a spirit too lofty to submit to such a government,
the people of the South have long
wished to aid you in throwing off this foreign
yoke, to enable you again to enjoy the inalienable
rights of freemen," read the address.</p>

<p>But the people were not conscious of living
under a foreign yoke, neither that they were a
conquered province, and therefore did not respond
to the call to rise in rebellion against the
old flag.</p>

<p>It was time for Lee to proceed to the execution
of his plans. The Army of the Potomac was approaching
Frederick. Lee directed Jackson to
move on the 10th of September directly west,
cross South Mountain at Boonsboro' Gap, move
through the town of Sharpsburg, cross the Potomac,
and fall upon Martinsburg, where Colonel
White, with a brigade of Union troops, was
guarding a large amount of stores. General McLaw's
and Anderson's divisions were to occupy
Maryland Heights&mdash;the termination of the South
Mountain range in Maryland&mdash;while General
Walker was sent across the river into Virginia to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
occupy Loudon Heights. Thus approaching from
the north, east, south, and west, Colonel Miles
would have no chance to escape. Longstreet was
to move to Hagerstown to be ready for a sudden
spring into Pennsylvania. Howell Cobb was to
hold Crampton's Pass, and D.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Hill the Boonsboro'
Gap.</p>

<p>"The commands of General Jackson, McLaw,
and Walker, after having accomplished the objects
for which they have been detached, will join
the main body of the army at Boonsboro' or Hagerstown,"
read the order.</p>

<p>On the 11th, the last regiment of Rebels departed
from Frederick, and soon after the advance
of the Army of the Potomac entered the
place. The inhabitants shouted, waved their
flags once more, and hailed McClellan as their
deliverer.</p>


<h3><a name="South"></a>BATTLE OF SOUTH MOUNTAIN.</h3>

<p>Early in the forenoon of Sunday, the 14th of
September, General Burnside, leading the Union
army, ascended a high hill, a few miles west of
Frederick, and looked down upon one of the loveliest
valleys in the world. At his feet was the
village of Middletown; beyond it, in the bottom
of the valley, the Catoctin Creek winds through
ever verdant meadows, past old mansions, surrounded
with well-filled barns. North and south,
far as the eye can reach, are wheat and clover
fields, and acres of corn putting on its russet
hues. Beyond the creek, the road winds along the
mountain side, past the little hamlet called Bolivar.
There are ledges, loose stones, groves of oak,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
and thickets of mountain shrubs. There is a
house on the summit,&mdash;once a tavern, where the
teamsters and stagemen of former days watered
their tired horses, and drank their ale, and ate a
lunch. It is old and dilapidated now. But standing
there and looking east, it seems as if a strong
armed man might cast a stone upon Middletown,
hundreds of feet below. Twelve miles away to
the east are the spires of Frederick, gleaming in
the sun. Westward from this mountain gate we
many behold at our feet Boonsboro' and Keedysville,
and the crooked Antietam; and still farther
westward, the Potomac, making its great northern
sweep to Williamsport. In the northwest,
twelve miles distant, is Hagerstown, at the head
of the Cumberland valley. Longstreet is there
on this Sunday morning, sending his cavalry up
to the Pennsylvania lines, gathering cattle,
horses, and pigs.</p>

<p>General D.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Hill beholds the Union army
spread out upon the plains before him, reaching
all the way to Frederick city,&mdash;dark-blue masses
moving towards him along the road, through the
fields, with banners waving, their bright arms
reflecting the morning sunshine.</p>

<p>He is confident that he can hold the place,&mdash;so
narrow,&mdash;the mountain sides so steep, and one
Southerner equal to five Yankees. He hates the
men of the north. He is a native of South Carolina,
and was educated by the government at
West Point. He was teacher of the North
Carolina Military School. Before the war, he did
what he could to stir up the people of the South
to rebel. He told them that the South won
nearly all the battles of the Revolution, but that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
the Northern historians had given the credit to
the North, which was a "Yankee trick." He published
an Algebra in 1857, which Stonewall Jackson
pronounced superior to all others, in which
his inveterate hatred appears. His problems are
expressive of hatred and contempt.</p>

<p>"A Yankee," he states, "mixes a certain number
of wooden nutmegs, which cost him one fourth
of a cent apiece, with real nutmegs worth four
cents apiece, and sells the whole assortment for
$44, and gains $3.75 by the fraud. How many
wooden nutmegs are there?"</p>

<p>"At the Woman's Rights Convention, held at
Syracuse, New York, composed of one hundred
and fifty delegates, the old maids, childless wives,
and bedlamites were to each other as the numbers
5, 7, and 3. How many were there of each class?"</p>

<p>"The field of Buena Vista is six and a half
miles from Saltillo. Two Indiana volunteers ran
away from the field of battle at the same time;
one ran half a mile per hour faster than the other,
and reached Saltillo five minutes and fifty four
and six elevenths seconds sooner than the other.

<p>On this bright morning, the men of the Nineteenth
Indiana, troops from Ohio, Wisconsin,
Michigan, Maine,&mdash;from nearly all the loyal
States,&mdash;are preparing to climb the mountain to
meet the man who has violated his oath, and who
hates the government that gave him an education.</p>

<p>The line of battle is formed by General Burnside
along the Catoctin Creek. The Ninth corps,
with General Cox's division in advance, is thrown
south of the turnpike, and directed to move along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
a narrow road which unites with the turnpike
in the gap.</p>

<p>It is seven o'clock in the morning when Scammon's
brigade of Ohio troops moves into position.
Robertson's battery is south of the turnpike in a
field, throwing shells up the mountain into the
woods where Hill's men are lying sheltered from
sight by the foliage.</p>

<p>There is a reply from the gap. Solid shot
and shells fly from the mountain to the valley.
Hayne's battery joins with Robertson's, Simmons
opens with his twenty-pounders, and McMullin
with four heavy guns, and while church-bells far
away are tolling the hour of worship, these cannon
in the valley and on the mountain side wake
the slumbering echoes, and play the prelude to
the approaching strife.</p>

<p>Scammon's brigade leads the way by the old
Sharpsburg road, the men toiling slowly up the
hill,&mdash;through the fields and pastures, over fences
and walls, sometimes losing foothold, and falling
headlong, or sliding downward.</p>

<p>The brigade was preceded by a line of skirmishers,
and was followed by Crook's brigade.</p>

<p>The woods were full of Rebels, but the men
moved on, driving back Hill's skirmishers, working
up step by step, pushing them and the line
supporting them toward the gap. A battery
opened with canister, but the shot flew wild and
high over their heads, and they pressed on. McMullin
sent up two guns, but the gunners were
picked off by the Rebel sharpshooters. The
Twelfth Ohio charged up the hill, through a pasture,
with a hurrah. Louder, deeper, longer was
the cheer which rose from the valley far below,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> where Sturgis, and Wilcox, and Rodman were
forming into line. On,&mdash;into the fire,&mdash;close up
to the stonewall, where the Rebels were lying,&mdash;they
charged, routing them from their shelter,
and holding the ground. There were places on
the hillside, where the green grass became crimson,&mdash;where
brave men had stood a moment before
full of life and vigor and devotion to their
country, but motionless and silent now,&mdash;their
part in the great struggle faithfully performed,
their work done.</p>

<p>Hill rallied his men. They dashed down the
mountain to regain the ground. But having obtained
it through costly sacrifice, the men from
Ohio were not willing to yield it.</p>

<p>There was a lull in the battle at noon. Hill,
finding that the chances were against him, sent to
Hagerstown for Longstreet.</p>

<p>Burnside, on the other hand, waited for Hooker
to arrive, who was next in the column. He commanded
the First corps, composed of Ricketts's
and King's divisions, and the Pennsylvania Reserves.
He filed north of the turnpike, threw
Ricketts's upon the extreme right, with the Reserves
in the center, and King on the left. King
was on the turnpike. There is a deep gorge between
the turnpike and the old road south of it,
which made a gap between Reno and Hooker.</p>

<p>The afternoon wore away before the troops
were ready. Longstreet's men were panting up
the mountain on the western side, Hood's division
in advance. They were thrown upon the hillside
south of the old tavern in the gap. It was past
four o'clock when the order to advance was given.
Wilcox's division led upon the extreme left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a movement which will be decisive, for
victory or defeat. The artillery&mdash;all the batteries
which can be brought into position&mdash;send their
shells up the mountain. Steadily onward moves
the long line across the fields at the foot, up the
pasture lands of the slope into the woods.</p>

<p>There is a rattling of musketry,&mdash;then heavy
rolls, peal on peal, wave on wave, and a steady,
constant roar; giving not an inch, but advancing
slowly, or holding their ground, the veterans of
the Peninsula continue their fire. The mountain
is white with the rising battle-cloud. The
line of fire goes up the mountain. The Rebels are
falling back, fighting bravely, but yielding. There
are shouts, yells, outcries, mingling with the
thunder of the artillery, echoing and reverberating
along the valleys.</p>

<p>Right and left and center are pushing on.
Thousands on the plains below behold it, and
wish that they were there to aid their brothers in
arms. The day wanes, the shadows begin to
deepen, revealing the flashes from cannon and
musket. There is no giving back of Burnside's
men, neither of Hooker's, but nearer to the
crest, nearer the clouds, moves the starry banner.</p>

<p>"Please open upon that house with your battery,"
was the order of Colonel Meredith, of the
Nineteenth Indiana, commanding a brigade in
King's division, to Lieutenant Stewart of the
Fourth United States Artillery. The house was
filled with sharpshooters. Lieutenant Stewart
sights his guns. The second shell crashes through
the side as if it were paper, tears through the
rooms. The Rebels swarm out from doors and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
windows in hasty flight. The men from Indiana
give a lusty cheer, and move nearer the enemy.</p>

<p>In vain the efforts of Hill and Longstreet and
Hood to stop the fiery tide, rising higher, rolling
nearer, overflowing the mountain, threatening to
sweep them into the western valley. The lines
surge on. It is like the sweep of a great tidal
wave. There is a rush, a short, desperate, decisive
struggle. The Rebel line gives way. The men
from Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin, New York, Pennsylvania,
Maine, and Massachusetts, pour into the
gap, shouting their victorious hurrahs.</p>

<p>General Hill has lost the battle. He has despised
those men. He tried to injure their fair
fame before the world in time of peace; he intimated
that Northern men were arrant cowards;
but after this battle at South Mountain he can
issue an Algebra with a new statement of the
wooden nutmeg and Buena Vista problems.</p>


<h3><a name="Surrender"></a>SURRENDER OF HARPER'S FERRY.</h3>

<p>Lee was successful in what he had undertaken
at Harper's Ferry. While Burnside was winning
this victory, Colonel Miles was yielding that important
post. He abandoned the strong position
on Maryland Heights, tumbled the cannon down
the mountain, when he might have kept McLaw
and Anderson from gaining possession of the
place. Jackson kept up a furious bombardment.
Miles hung out the white flag, and was killed
immediately after by a shell.</p>

<p>His troops were indignant at the surrender.
Some shed tears.</p>

<p>"We have no country now," said one officer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
wiping the tears from his face. If Miles had
held out a little longer, he would have been relieved,
for Franklin was driving General Cobb
from Crampton's Pass, and would have been upon
the rear of McLaw and Anderson.</p>

<p>The cavalry made their escape under cover of
the night. They followed winding forest-paths
through the woods, at dead of night, avoiding
the roads till they were north of Sharpsburg.
While crossing the Williamsport and Hagerstown
road they came upon Longstreet's ammunition
train.</p>

<p>"Hold!" said the officer commanding the cavalry
to the forward driver, "you are on the wrong
road. That is the way."</p>

<p>The driver turned towards the north as directed,
not knowing that the officer was a Yankee.</p>

<p>"Hold on there! you are on the wrong road.
Who told you to turn off here, I should like to
know?" shouted the Rebel officer in charge of the
train, dashing up on his horse.</p>

<p>"I gave the order, sir."</p>

<p>"Who are you, and what right have you to
interfere with my train, sir," said the officer,
coming up in the darkness.</p>

<p>"I am colonel of the Eighth New York cavalry,
and you are my prisoner," said the Union officer,
presenting his pistol.</p>

<p>The Rebel officer was astounded. He swore bad
words, and said it was a mean Yankee trick.</p>

<p>One hundred wagons and seventy-four men
were thus quietly cut out from the Rebel trains.</p>

<p>I saw the prisoners as they entered Chambersburg,
Pennsylvania. There were several negroes
among them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>"As soon as I heard dat we was in de hands of
de Yankees, I was mighty glad, sir, 'cause we
darkees want to get to de Norf," he said.</p>

<p>"Why do you want to get to the North?"</p>

<p>"'Cause we be free up here. We don't get
much to eat in the Souf," he said.</p>

<p>At the head of this company of prisoners
marched a man with downcast eyes, sunburned,
dusty, dressed in gray, with a black feather in
his hat. His name was Fitz Hugh Miller. He
was a Pennsylvanian. It was he who arrested
Cook, one of John Brown's accomplices, and delivered
him over to Governor Wise. Cook was
tried, found guilty, and hung. When the war
broke out, Miller went South, and was a captain
in Lee's army. The people of Chambersburg knew
him. He was a traitor.</p>

<p>"Hang him!" they shouted. "A rope!"
"Get a rope!" There was a rush of men and
women towards him. They were greatly excited.
Some picked up stones to hurl at him, some
shook their fists in his face, but the guards closed
round him, and hurried the pale and trembling
wretch off to prison as quickly as possible, and
saved him from a violent death.</p>

<p>General Lee had been successful in taking
Harper's Ferry, but he was not in position to
spring upon the North. The eastern gates were
wide open. Burnside had pushed D.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Hill and
Longstreet down the Mountain, and the whole
Yankee army which he intended to keep out of
the Antietam and Cumberland valleys was pouring
upon him. He had been successful in most of
his battles. He had driven McClellan from Richmond
to the gunboats, had defeated Pope at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
Groveton, had taken eleven thousand prisoners
and immense supplies at Harper's Ferry. All
that he had to do now was to defeat the new Army
of the Potomac in a great pitched battle; then he
could move on to Philadelphia and dictate terms
of peace.</p>

<p>He resolved to concentrate his army, choose his
ground, and give battle to McClellan. He must
do that before he could move on. The advance of
the Rebel army towards Pennsylvania roused
the citizens of that Commonwealth to take active
measures for its defense.</p>

<p>There were glorious exhibitions of pure patriotism.
Governor Curtin called upon the people
to organize at once; and fifty thousand men hastened
to the various places of rendezvous. The
old Revolutionary flame was rekindled. Disaster
had not dispirited the people. The ministers from
their pulpits urged their congregations to go, and
themselves set the example. Judges, members of
Congress, presidents of colleges, and professors
took place in the ranks, and became soldiers. In
every town the pulses of the people beat to the
exigencies of the hour. Telegrams and letters
poured in upon the Governor. "We are ready,"
"We shall march to-morrow," "Give us guns,"
they said.</p>

<p>Mothers, wives, and daughters said, "Go!"</p>

<p>There were tearful eyes and swelling bosoms,
but brave hearts. Old men, gray-haired, weak,
weary with the weight of years, encouraged the
young and strong, and bestowed their blessings
on those departing for the battle-field.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<h3>BATTLE OF ANTIETAM.</h3>


<p><span class="firstwords">The</span> army had been re-organized. It was not
altogether the same army which had fought the
battles of the Peninsula. The First corps, under
the command of General Hooker, contained
Doubleday's, Meade's, and Ricketts's divisions.
Doubleday's troops were formerly under McDowell.
They had been under fire at Cedar Mountain,
and held the left at Groveton.</p>

<p>Meade commanded the Pennsylvania Reserves.
McCall, their first commander, was a prisoner.
Reynolds, who succeeded to the command, was
in Pennsylvania organizing the militia. The Reserves
had been in many of the battles,&mdash;Dranesville,
Mechanicsville, Gaines's Mills, Glendale,
Malvern, Groveton, and South Mountain.</p>

<p>Ricketts's troops were of McDowell's corps,
formerly King's division. They too had been in
the hottest of the fight at Groveton.</p>

<p>The Second corps was still in the hands of the
veteran Sumner. Sedgwick, Richardson, and
French were his division commanders.</p>

<p>Sedgwick and Richardson had been through
the Peninsular campaign. They came up at Fair
Oaks in a critical moment, and decided the day
in that hard-fought battle. They had stood motionless
through the long summer day at Savage
Station,&mdash;a wall of adamant against Stonewall
Jackson and Magruder. Richardson held the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
bridge at White-Oak Swamp, while Sedgwick with
Hooker repulsed A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;Hill at Glendale. French's
troops had been under General Wool at Fortress
Monroe and Norfolk. They had seen skirmishes,
but had never been engaged in a great battle.
French had one brigade of new troops, fresh from
the home barracks, inexperienced in drill and discipline,
and unacquainted with the indescribable
realities of a great battle. It was a powerful
corps.</p>

<p>The Sixth corps was commanded by Franklin,
and was composed of Smith's and Slocum's divisions,
old soldiers of the Peninsula. A portion
of them were engaged in the battle of Williamsburg.
Smith's division was in the fight at Fair
Oaks; and Slocum crossed to the north bank of
the Chickahominy, in season to save Fitz-John
Porter from annihilation in the battle of Gaines's
Mills. They held the rear at White-Oak Swamp,
and had borne their share in the battle of Malvern.</p>

<p>The Fifth corps was commanded by Porter,
and was composed of Sykes's division of Regulars
and Morell's division; the same which had
fought gloriously at Gaines's Mills, and Malvern,
and reluctantly at Groveton.</p>

<p>The Ninth corps was commanded by Burnside.
He had four divisions,&mdash;Wilcox's, Sturgis's, Rodman's,
and Cox's.</p>

<p>Sturgis's and Rodman's troops were Burnside's
own, which had a good record at Roanoke and
Newbern. Wilcox's were of Sherman's army
from Port Royal, and had seen some of the hardships
of campaigning. They had been hurried up
from the South, when it was discovered that Lee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
contemplated an invasion of the North. The
Thirty-fifth Massachusetts in this corps had been
but a few days in the service. How well they
fought, we shall see hereafter.</p>

<p>The troops commanded by General Cox were of
the Kanawha division,&mdash;Western Virginia and
Ohio soldiers, who had seen service among the
mountains.</p>

<p>The Twelfth corps, which had fought at Winchester
and Cedar Mountain under Banks, was
now commanded by General Mansfield. It contained
but two divisions, Williams's and Greene's.</p>

<p>Couch commanded an independent division, the
troops which had stemmed the tide at Seven
Pines.</p>

<p>These corps composed the Army of the Potomac,
which was organized into three grand divisions.</p>

<p>Burnside commanded the right wing, having
his own,&mdash;the Ninth and First corps. General
Cox commanded the Ninth after the death of Reno
at South Mountain, and the appointment of Burnside
to the command of the grand division.</p>

<p>The center was under the command of Sumner,
and was composed of the Second and Twelfth
corps,&mdash;his own and Mansfield's.</p>

<p>The left wing was commanded by Franklin,
and was composed of the Fifth and Sixth corps.</p>

<p>General Lee's army was composed of the commands
of Jackson, Longstreet, D.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Hill, McLaw,
and Walker.</p>

<p>An estimate of his forces in the battle of Antietam,
obtained from prisoners, deserters, and
spies, is ninety-seven thousand.</p>

<p>"It was fought for half a day with forty-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
thousand men on the Confederate side, and for
the remaining half with no more than an aggregate
of seventy thousand,"<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> writes a Southern
historian, who estimates McClellan's force at a
hundred and thirty thousand.</p>

<p>The ground which General Lee selected for a
decisive trial of the strength of the two armies is
near the village of Sharpsburg, between the Antietam
and Potomac Rivers. It is a quiet little
village at the junction of the Hagerstown turnpike,
with the pike leading from Boonsboro' to
Shepardstown. Hagerstown is twelve miles distant,
due north; Shepardstown, three and a half
miles, a little south of west, on the Potomac.</p>

<p>In former years, it was a lively place. There
were always country teams and market wagons
rumbling through the town, but now the innkeepers
have few travelers to eat their bacon
and eggs. The villagers meet at nightfall at the
hotel, smoke their pipes, drink a glass of the landlord's
ale, and tell the story of the great battle.</p>

<p>The Antietam is a rapid, crooked mill-stream.
It rises north of Hagerstown, on the borders of
Pennsylvania, runs toward the south, and empties
into the Potomac, three miles south of Sharpsburg.
Its banks are steep. In some places there
are limestone ledges cropping out. At low water,
it is fordable in many places, but when the clouds
hang low upon the mountains and give out their
showers, it roars, foams, tumbles like a cataract.</p>

<p>Three miles northwest of the town, the Potomac
makes a great bend to the east, comes within
a half mile of the Hagerstown pike, then bears
south toward Shepardstown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>Across the Antietam, three miles from Sharpsburg,
to the southeast, is the northern end of Elk
Ridge,&mdash;a mountain running south to Harper's
Ferry, forming the west wall of Pleasant Valley.</p>

<p>The Antietam, below the Boonesboro' road,
runs along the western base of the ridge. It is
not more than four miles from the Antietam, opposite
the head of the ridge, to the great bend in
the Potomac, northwest of Sharpsburg. General
Lee selected this narrow gate for his line of battle.
It had many advantages. It was a short line.
It could not be flanked. It was on commanding
ground. General McClellan must attack in front.
He must cross the Antietam, ascend the steep
bank, over ground swept by hundreds of guns, and
face a direct as well as a flanking fire. McClellan
could not turn the right flank of the Rebels, because
there the Antietam runs close to the base of
Elk Ridge, then turns due west, and empties into
the Potomac. He could not turn the left flank,
for there the Rebel army leaned upon the Potomac.</p>


<p>The dotted line passing through Jackson's position is a narrow farm
road, along which Jackson erected his defensive works.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides these protections to the flank, the line
itself was very strong. There were hills, hollows,
ravines, groves, ledges, fences, cornfields, orchards,
stone-walls,&mdash;all of which are important
in a great battle. Besides all of those natural
defenses, General Lee threw up breastworks and
rifle-pits to make his line as strong as possible.
His line was on the ridge, between the Antietam
and the Potomac.</p>

<p>There are three stone bridges across the Antietam
near where the battle was fought. One of
them will be known in history as the Burnside
Bridge, for there the troops commanded by General
Burnside forced back the Rebel right wing,
and crossed the stream. It is on the road which
leads from Sharpsburg to the little village of Roherville
in Pleasant Valley.</p>

<p>A mile north, there is another at the crossing
of the Boonesboro' and Sharpsburg turnpike. A
half mile above, on the eastern bank, there is a
large brick farm-house, where General McClellan
had his head-quarters during the battle. Following
the windings of the stream, we reach the
upper bridge, on the road from Keedysville
to Hagerstown. On the western bank are
the farms of John Hoffman and D.&nbsp;Miller.
There is a little cluster of houses called Smoketown.</p>

<p>Traveling directly west from Hoffman's one
mile across the fields, we reach the Sharpsburg
and Hagerstown pike, near the residence of Mr.
Middlekauff. A quarter of a mile farther would
carry us to the great bend of the Potomac. But
turning south, and traveling the turnpike, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
reach the farm-house of Mr. John Poffenberger,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a>
a wooden building standing with its gable towards
the turnpike. There are peach-trees in
front, and a workshop, and a bee-bench.</p>

<p>There is a high ridge behind the house, crowned
by Poffenberger's barn. Standing upon the ridge
and looking west, we behold the turnpike at our
feet, a mown field beyond, and fifty or sixty rods
distant a cornfield, and a grove of oaks. That
cornfield and those oaks is the ground occupied
by Jackson's left wing.</p>

<p>A few rods south of Poffenberger's is the toll-gate.
There a narrow lane runs west towards
the Potomac. Another leads southwest, past an
old house and barn, winding through the woods,
and over the uneven ground where Jackson established
his center. There is a grove of oaks
between the toll-gate and the farm-house of Mr.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;Miller, a few rods further south. Mr. Miller
had a large field in corn on the hillside east of
his house at the time of the battle. Standing
there upon the crest and looking east, we have a
full view of the farm of John Hoffman. Here
and on the ridge behind Poffenberger's, Jackson
established his advanced line one half of a mile
from his main line, west of the turnpike.</p>

<p>The cornfield was bordered on the east by a
narrow strip of woodland, on the south by a newly
mown field extending to the turnpike.</p>

<p>Walking across the smooth field to the turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>pike
again, we behold a small one-story brick
building on the west side of the road, with an
oak grove behind it. It has no tower or spire,
but it is known as the Dunker Church. A road
joins the turnpike in front of the church, coming
in from the northeast from Hoffman's farm and
the upper bridge across the Antietam.</p>

<p>This building is on elevated ground. It was
the pivot on which the fortunes of the day swung
to and fro, where hinged the destiny of the nation.
There Jackson's right wing joined D.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Hill's division. There, around the church, fifty
thousand men met in deadly strife.</p>

<p>The land slopes towards the east. Rivulets
spring from the hillside, and flow towards the
Antietam. Seventy or eighty rods east of the
church is the residence of Mr. Muma. There is
a graveyard north of his dwelling, white headstones
marking the burial-place. There is a farm-road
leading past his house to Mr. Rulet's beyond.
It winds along the hillside into the ravine by Mr.
Rulet's. There are branch roads; one leading to
Sharpsburg, one down the hill to the middle
bridge across the Antietam. The farms of Mr.
Muma, Mr. Rulet, and Dr. Piper are broken lands,
hills, ravines, corn and wheat fields, orchards,
pastures, and mowing-grounds. D.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Hill occupied
the high grounds on Mr. Muma's farm; Longstreet
held Rulet's, Dr. Piper's, Sharpsburg, and
the hills south of the town.</p>

<p>Standing by the church and looking north, we
see Poffenberger's house, three fourths of a mile
distant; northeast we see Hoffman's farm, a mile
and a half distant. Looking directly east over
the house of Mr. Rulet, we behold the Antietam,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
one mile distant, with General McClellan's head-quarters
on the hill beyond.</p>

<p>Southeast, a mile and a quarter distant, is the
middle bridge on the Boonesboro' pike. Directly
south, along the Hagerstown turnpike, is Sharpsburg.
Lee's head-quarters are in a field west of
the town. Two miles distant, at the base of Elk
Ridge, is the lower bridge. There the banks of
the river are high, sharp, and steep. Behind the
church are limestone ledges; in the woods, strong
natural defenses.</p>

<p>These are the main features of the field:&mdash;</p>

<p>Hoffman's farm.</p>

<p>Poffenberger's house, the ridge behind it, the
woods, and cornfields west of it.</p>

<p>Miller's house, the cornfield east, the mown
field south, the turnpike and the woods west.</p>

<p>The church, the field in front, the woods behind
it.</p>

<p>Muma's farm, Rulet's house, the orchard
around it, the farm-road, and cornfield west of it.</p>

<p>The lower bridge, and the hills on both sides
of the stream.</p>

<p>At daylight on Monday morning, after the battle
at South Mountain, General Richardson's division
of the Second Corps moved down the mountain
side through Boonesboro' to Keedysville. It
was found that General Lee was massing his
troops on the west bank of the Antietam, and
planting his batteries on the hills north of Sharpsburg.
General Richardson deployed his troops.
Captain Tidball and Captain Pettit ran their batteries
up on the hills near Porterstown, and commenced
a cannonade which lasted till night.</p>

<p>General Hooker's, General Mansfield's, General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
Burnside's, General Sumner's, and General Porter's
troops arrived during the night.</p>

<p>On the morning of Tuesday, the 16th, General
McClellan reconnoitered the position which Lee
had chosen. The forenoon passed before the corps
were in position to make an attack.</p>

<p>General McClellan's plan was to attack the enemy's
left with Hooker's and Mansfield's corps,
supported by Sumner's; and, as soon as matters
looked favorably there, to move Burnside across
the lower bridge, and attack Lee's right, south
of Sharpsburg. If either of these flank movements
were successful, then he would move
upon the center with all the forces at his disposal.</p>

<p>About two o'clock in the afternoon, Hooker
crossed the Antietam by the upper bridge and by
the ford near Pray's Mill. The Rebel pickets
were in the cornfields on Mr. Hoffman's farm, and
their first line in the strip of woods east of Miller's
cornfield. The Pennsylvania Reserves were
in advance. There was a sharp skirmish and a
brisk cannonade which lasted till dark. The Rebels
were forced back. They retreated almost to
Poffenberger's house. General Hooker advanced,
planted his guns on the hill near Hoffman's, and
threw out his pickets. His men lay down to sleep
in the fields and amid the rustling corn.</p>

<p>Mansfield crossed during the night. He went
up from the stream but a short distance, halting
nearly a mile in rear of Hooker. Sumner's corps
remained east of the stream, near Pray's Mill.
Porter was posted on the east side near General
McClellan's head-quarters, while Burnside passed
down through Porterstown and came into posi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>tion
on the farm of Mr. Rohrbach at the base of
Elk Ridge, near the lower bridge.</p>

<p>An auspicious hour had passed by never to return.
Lee had only Longstreet, D.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Hill, and
two divisions of Jackson's corps on the ground
on Tuesday, the 16th. Jackson arrived on the
morning of the 16th, after a hard night-march
from Harper's Ferry. His troops were exhausted.
They were not in condition to fight on Tuesday;
but by the delay of General McClellan they obtained
rest and strength. McLaw's, Anderson's,
Walker's, and A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;Hill's divisions had not arrived
even when the great contest began on the
17th.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></p>

<p>A portion of Lee's line on the morning of that
day was weak and thin. Longstreet held the
right, opposite Burnside; D.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Hill was on Rulet's
farm, Hood was at the Dunker Church, and
Jackson northwest of it, in front of Poffenberger's
house. Hood's men were exhausted; they had
marched rapidly to reach the field, and had been
sent to the front upon their arrival, to keep
Hooker in check, as he moved through Hoffman's
cornfields on the afternoon of the 16th. Lawton,
commanding Ewell's old division in Jackson's
corps, relieved him during the night. At daybreak
the "Ragged Texans," as Hood's men were
called by their comrades, were cooking their cakes
and frying their pork in the fields south of the
church. Lee's head-quarters were on a hill beyond
Sharpsburg, so high that he could overlook
a large portion of the field. He saw that McClellan
intended to turn his left, and threw all
his available troops towards the Dunker Church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>On the morning of the 17th a breeze from the
south swept up the valley, rolling dark clouds
upon the mountains. There was a light fog upon
the Antietam. Long before daylight the word,
which roused the men from sleep, passed along
the lines of Hooker's divisions. Without a drum-beat
or bugle-call the soldiers rose, shook the
dewdrops from their locks, rolled their blankets,
and ate their breakfast.</p>

<p>The pickets of the two armies were so near
each other that each could hear the rustle of the
corn as they paced to and fro amid the rows.
Occasionally there was a shot. Once, in the night,
there was a volley beyond the woods towards
Muma's. General Hooker was asleep in a barn
near Hoffman's. He sprang to his feet, stood by
the door, and listened. "We have no troops in
that direction. They are shooting at nothing," he
said, and lay down once more.</p>


<h3><a name="Hooker"></a>HOOKER'S ATTACK.</h3>

<p>Five o'clock. It is hardly daylight, as the
pickets, straining their sight, bringing their
muskets to a level with their eyes, aim at the
dusky forms stirring amid the corn-leaves, and
renew the contest. There are bright flashes from
the strip of woods, and from the ridge behind
Poffenberger's. The first Rebel shell bursts in
the Sixth Wisconsin, prostrating eight men.
Hooker's guns, in the edge of the woods west of
Hoffman's, are quick to respond.</p>

<p>Meade's division, composed of Seymour's, Magilton's,
and Anderson's brigades, was in the
center of Hooker's corps, and also in the advance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
Doubleday was on the right, and Ricketts behind
Meade.</p>

<p>The order was given to Meade to move on, and
to Ricketts and Doubleday to keep within close
supporting distance. The direction taken by
Meade brought him through the strip of woods
northeast of Miller's house. Lawton's division of
Jackson's corps held the ground by Miller's
house, with Ripley, of D.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Hill's division, joining
on the narrow road north of Muma's, a quarter
of a mile in front of the church.</p>

<p>At this early hour, before any movement was
made, Tuft, Langner, Von Kleizer, Weaver, Weed,
and Benjamin, with twenty-pounder Parrott
guns, planted on the hills east of the Antietam,
between the center and lower bridges, opened
upon Lee's lines, throwing shells and solid shot
into Sharpsburg, and upon D.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Hill on Rulet's
farm. "It enfiladed my line, and was a damaging
fire,"<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> says Stonewall Jackson, who brought
up his batteries of heavy guns,&mdash;Prague's, Carpenter's,
Raine's, Brokenbrough's, Caskie's, and
Wooding's batteries.</p>

<p>Meade's men went cheerily to the work. They
began at long range to give their volleys; they
were in the hollow, northeast of Miller's. Lawton's
troops looked down upon them from
their shelter beneath the trees and behind the
hills.</p>

<p>The Reserves began to drop beneath the galling
fire. Hooker rode up to them upon a powerful
white horse. The bullets flew past him, cutting
down the corn, and bursting shells sprinkled him
with earth; but he was calm amid it all, directing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
the troops and holding them up to the work by his
mighty will.</p>

<p>Nearer to the woods now, shorter the range,
more deadly the fire. Ricketts came up on the
left with Duryea's and Christian's brigades.</p>

<p>There were heavier volleys from the cornfield
and open ground, fainter replies from the woods.
It was an indication that Lawton was growing
weaker.</p>

<p>"Forward!" It was an electric word. The
Reserves, with Ricketts's two brigades, went up
with a cheer into the woods, through into the
open field, following the fleeing Rebels, who were
streaming past Miller's, over the field in front of
the church, into the woods behind it. The Reserves
reached the middle of the field; but now
from the woods into which Lawton had fled there
were quick volleys of musketry and rapid cannon
shots from Hayes's, and Trimble's, and Walker's,
and Douglas's, and Starke's brigades of Jackson's
division.</p>

<p>The Reserves stopped in the middle of the field.
They gave a few volleys. The men dropped fast.
Some of the wounded crawled, some hobbled
away; others lay where they fell, motionless forever.
The living turned and sought the shelter of
the woods, from which they had driven the enemy.</p>

<p>The aspect of affairs suddenly changed. Jackson
moved forward his whole line, not only across
the field in front of the church, but extended farther
north, towards Poffenberger's. "Send me
your best brigade," was the message from Hooker
to Ricketts. Hartsuff, of Ricketts's division, had
not been engaged. A portion only of Doubleday's
troops had been in. Hartsuff was on the hill be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>hind
Poffenberger. His troops, the Twelfth and
Thirteenth Massachusetts, Ninth New York, and
Eleventh Pennsylvania, went down the hill upon
the run, south towards Miller's, past the retreating
brigades, closing in like an iron gate between
them and the exultant enemy. They came into
line upon the crest of the hill, crowning it with
their dark forms, and covering it with flame and
smoke.</p>

<p>"I think they will hold it," said General
Hooker, as he watched them presenting an unbroken
front. Jackson pushed on his brigades,
but they recoiled before the steady and destructive
fire rolled out by Hartsuff, also by Gibbons,
and Patrick, who were holding the ridge by Poffenberger's.
Jackson's line melted away. "At
this early hour," says Jackson, in his report,
"General Starke was killed; Colonel Douglas,
commanding Lawton's brigade, was killed; General
Lawton, commanding a division, and Colonel
Walker, commanding a brigade, were severely
wounded. More than half of the brigades of Lawton
and Hayes were killed or wounded; and more
than a third of Trimble's; and all the regimental
commanders in those brigades except two, were
killed or wounded."<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></p>

<p>Once more the Rebels retired to the woods behind
the church. There was a lull in the storm.
The shattered brigades of Jackson went to the
rear, taking shelter behind the ledges. Hood, with
his ragged Texans, came to the front by the
church. Stuart, who was out on Jackson's left,
towards the Potomac, came up with his artillery.
Early's division also came to the front, all form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>ing
on the uneven ground west and northwest of
the church in the woods; also Taliaferro's, Jones's,
and Winder's brigades.</p>

<p>Hooker was quick to plant his batteries. Those
of Doubleday's division galloped to the ridge
northeast of Poffenberger's house. Gibbons's,
Cooper's, Easton's, Gerrish's, Durell's, and Monroe's,
were wheeled into position. Projectiles of
every form cut the air. The oak-trees of the
grove by Miller's were splintered and torn, the
branches were wrenched from the trunks, and
hurled to the earth.</p>

<p>Rebel shells tore through Poffenberger's house
knocking out the gable, ripping up the roof, tossing
boards and shingles into the air. The beehives
in the yard were tumbled over, and the angry
swarms went out, stinging friend and foe.</p>

<p>Hooker had crossed the turnpike, and was a
few hundred feet beyond the toll-house. Hartsuff
was wounded and carried from the field. The
Reserves, broken and exhausted, were in the rear,
too much shattered to be relied on in an emergency.
Ricketts's brigades, which had met D.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Hill, had fallen back. Hartsuff's, Gibbons's, and
Patrick's alone were in front.</p>

<p>It was nearly eight o'clock, and Hooker's troops
thus far had borne the whole of the contest unaided.
They had driven Jackson from his front
line, had assaulted his second, had received, like
a stalwart knight of the olden time, unflinchingly
the heavy blow which the Rebel commander had
given.</p>

<p>Hooker rode forward and reconnoitered.</p>

<p>"That is the key to the position," he said,
pointing toward the church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell Mansfield to send up a division," was
the order sent to this venerable officer, who was
slowly advancing from Hoffman's farm.</p>

<p>Williams's division went up into the strip of
woods east of the cornfield, Crawford's brigade
on the right, and Gordon's on the left.</p>

<p>"Tell Doubleday to hold them on the right.
Don't let them turn our flank," was the word
sent up to Doubleday, who was quietly watching
the Rebels from the cornfield west of Poffenberger's.</p>

<p>There were signs of an advance of Jackson's
line.</p>

<p>"Keep them well stirred up," was the message
to the artillerymen. The thirty-six guns planted
on the ridge reopened.</p>

<p>"I cannot advance, but I can hold my ground,"
said Ricketts.</p>

<p>While Crawford and Gordon were forming,
General Mansfield was mortally wounded and
borne to the rear, and the command of the corps
devolved on General Williams. Green's division
came up and formed on the right of Williams's,
now commanded by Gordon, reaching south nearly
to Muma's house. King's, Cothran's and Hampton's
batteries, belonging to the Twelfth Corps,
opened a rapid fire. The One Hundred and
Twenty-third Pennsylvania was pushed across the
turnpike into the woods west of Miller's, near the
toll-gate.</p>

<p>While making these dispositions General
Hooker dismounted and walked to the extreme
front. There was a constant fire of musketry from
the woods. He passed through it all, returned to
his horse, and once more was in the saddle. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
was in range of the Rebels. There was a heavy
volley. A bullet entered his foot, inflicting a
painful wound. Three men fell near him on the
instant. But he issued his orders with coolness
and deliberation. "Tell Crawford and Gordon to
carry those woods and hold them," he said to his
aide as he rode slowly to the rear. He tried to
keep in the saddle, but fainted. "You must leave
the field and have your wound attended to," said
the surgeon. It was with great reluctance that
he rode to the rear; but Sumner at that moment
was going up with his superb corps, the Second,
which had never quailed before the enemy.</p>

<p>Williams formed his line, his own division on
the right, and Green's on the left.</p>

<p>Patrick and Gibbons were moved down to the
turnpike. The troops were enthusiastic. They
had driven the enemy, had captured battle-flags
and prisoners.</p>

<p>Gordon and Crawford advanced over the mown
field, across the turnpike, into the woods, and
poured in their fire. Jackson replied. The woods
were all aflame. From every tree, and knoll, and
ledge, and hillock, there were volleys of musketry,
and flashes of artillery.</p>

<p>It was a terrible fire. Gordon and Crawford
were close upon the Rebel lines, behind the ledges
and the breastwork which they had thrown up.
They almost broke through. A little more power,
the support of another brigade, the pushing in of
another division at this moment, and Jackson
would have been forced from his stronghold; and
if driven from that position he must fight in the
smooth fields beyond, or be folded back upon the
center and right, with the door half opened for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
Hooker to march upon Shepardstown and cut off
the retreat.</p>

<p>It is nearly nine o'clock when Gordon and
Crawford stand within three hundred feet of the
Rebel line, in the woods northwest of the church.
They face west. They fight Grigsby, Stafford,
and Stuart of Jackson's corps.</p>

<p>It is a critical moment with Jackson. The
Yankees must be repulsed or all is lost. Early's
and Hood's divisions are behind the church.</p>

<p>Early moves north, sweeping past the church.
He strikes Crawford's flank and rear, and forces
him back. Green hastens up to sustain Crawford,
and is also driven across the turnpike into the
field nearly to the strip of woods west of it.</p>


<h3><a name="Sumner"></a>SUMNER'S ATTACK.</h3>

<p>Sedgwick's division of Sumner's corps has been
coming into line in Miller's cornfield. If it had
been earlier on the ground it would have been of
infinite value. It is a noble division, led by an
able commander.</p>

<p>General Sumner himself is there, gray-haired,
sober, vigilant, watchful. He examines the
ground and the positions of the enemy.</p>

<p>Sedgwick forms his division in three lines. Dana
in front, Gorman in the second, and Howard
in the third line. They pass in front of Mansfield's
troops towards the church.</p>

<p>Jackson has been hurrying up reinforcements.
The troops which have been on the march from
Harper's Ferry are brought in.</p>

<p>"By this time," says Jackson, "the expected
reinforcements, consisting of Semmes's, and An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>derson's,
and a part of Barksdale's, of McLaw's
division, arrived, and the whole, including Grigsby's
command, now united, charged upon the enemy,
checking his advance, then driving him
back with great slaughter."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></p>

<p>Jackson's line unites with D.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Hill's in the
field between the church and Muma's house.
Muma's is east of the church. Sedgwick is
northeast of it. As Sedgwick approaches the
church, Jackson swings up his right wing from
the field by Muma's. Sedgwick's second and
third lines are close upon the first. The solid
shot which the Rebel batteries fire cut through
all the lines. The bullets which miss the men
in Dana's brigade take effect in Gorman's, and
those which pass Gorman strike down Howard's
men.</p>

<p>Dana's brigade was close upon the enemy.
The hot blasts from the Rebel artillery, and the
sheets of flame from the infantry, scorched and
withered the line. The volleys given in return
were exceedingly destructive. But Gorman's
and Howard's men stood with ordered arms,
chafing under the terrible fire, without being able
to give a reply. They were so close upon Dana
that they could do nothing. Fifteen minutes has
passed. Dana's brigade is lost from sight. By
stooping, and laying my eyes near the ground, I
can see the dusky forms of the men through the
drifting cloud. They are holding their position.</p>

<p>But the troops which Jackson has been swinging
up on his right, which have been hidden
from Sedgwick and Sumner, suddenly appear.
They seem to rise from the ground as they come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
over the ridge of land in the field between the
church and Muma's house. They move northeast
to gain Sedgwick's rear.</p>

<p>"Change front!" is the quick, imperative
order from Sumner to Howard. The third line
under Howard has been facing southwest. The
regiments break rank, move out in files, and form
once more, facing southeast.</p>

<p>There is confusion. Some men think it an
order to retreat, and move towards Miller's cornfield.
The Rebel line advances in beautiful
order. Howard is beset by three times his number
of men. Gorman is attacked on his left.
The Rebels pour a volley into the backs of his
men. The whole force is outflanked.</p>

<p>A retreat is ordered, and the regiments fall
back through Miller's cornfield to the woods.</p>

<p>The Rebels are strong and exultant. They
cheer and scream and swing their caps. They
think that they have won a victory. They press
on to regain the woods from which they were
driven in the morning.</p>

<p>"Form behind the batteries," shouts Sumner,
riding along the lines. The troops are not panic-stricken.
They are cool and deliberate.</p>

<p>Tompkins, Kirby, Bartlett, and Owen are
ready with their howitzers. "Give them canister!"
is the order.</p>

<p>The batteries are posted along the ridge, in the
cornfield. The limbers and caissons are a few
rods down the slope. The horses nibble the
corn, they prick up their ears a little when a
shot screams past, but are so accustomed to the
firing that they do not mind it much.</p>

<p>Gorman, Dana, and lastly Howard, who has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
stood like a protecting wall, gain the rear of the
batteries, and the field is open for them.</p>

<p>The Rebels advance. The batteries open. The
discharges are rapid. No troops can live under
such a fire. In five minutes it is decided that
they cannot force the Union troops from the
cornfield, nor from the woods east of it. They
retreat once more to the church and to the ravine
by Muma's.</p>

<p>Sedgwick has been engaged a half hour, but
his loss has been great.</p>

<p>The Fifteenth Massachusetts was in Gorman's
brigade,&mdash;the regiment which fought so nobly at
Poolesville.</p>

<p>Twenty-four officers and five hundred and
eighty-two men marched towards the church,
but in twenty minutes three hundred and forty-three
were killed and wounded. Other regiments
suffered as much.</p>

<p>Jackson's loss was as severe as Sedgwick's.</p>

<p>General Hood, in his official report, says:
"Here I witnessed the most terrible clash of arms
by far that has occurred during the war."<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></p>

<p>"A little world of artillery was turned loose

Texas.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></p>

<p>In Dana's line is the Nineteenth Massachusetts.
It fought at Fair Oaks, Savage Station, White-Oak
Swamp, Glendale, and Malvern. Its ranks have
been sadly thinned. A great many brave men
have fallen, but those who survive emulate the
deeds of their comrades. They remember one who
fell in front of Richmond,&mdash;a descendant of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a><br><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
glorious Revolutionary sire, the patriot Putnam,
relative of the young officer,&mdash;Lieutenant
Putnam, who fell mortally wounded at Ball's
Bluff. He was born where the old General played
in his childhood, before he became a rifle-ranger
fighting the Indians in the dark forest bordering
Lake Champlain. They could not forget Robert
Winthrop Putnam, the frail and feeble boy. He
was but sixteen years old when the flag was insulted
at Sumter. His whole soul was on fire.
He resolved to enlist. The surgeons would not
accept him, he was so weak and slender. Again
and again he tried to become a soldier, but was as
often rejected.</p>

<p>The fire of patriotism burned within his breast.
He slept in the room which his great ancestor
had occupied in his youth. He sat by the window
through the moonlit nights, and carved a wooden
sword, thus feeding the consuming flame. On
one side he cut this motto:&mdash;</p>

<div class="centerpoemshort">
<div class="poem">
<span class="ia"><span class="smcap">"Not to be drawn without Justice;</span><br></span>
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Not to be sheathed without Honor."</span></span>
</div></div>

<p>Upon the other side, giving vent to his pent-up
soul, were these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemline">
<span class="i0">"<span class="smcap">Death to Traitors!</span>"<br></span>
</div>

<p>He brooded upon his disappointment by day
and dreamed of it at night. He made one more
effort. No questions were asked; he was accepted,
and became a soldier. He was intelligent,
manly, courageous, and temperate. His
drink was cold water. Calmly and deliberately
he bade farewell to his aged parents and his
young sister and brother, turned from the <a name="tn_png_200"></a><!--TN: Illegible word on Page 199 changed to "dear" based on other printings of this book-->dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
scenes of home and childhood, hallowed by ever
fragrant memories, buckled on his knapsack, and
took his place in the ranks. When mortally
wounded he refused to leave the field, but
cheered his comrades in the fight. In his last
letter, written to his sister, dated on the eve of
battle, he wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I left home to help defend a Constitution that
was second to none in the world, a flag which
every nation on earth respected; and if I am to
die, I shall be happy to die in the service of my
country."</p>

<p>The boy-soldier was gone from the ranks, but
his spirit was there, an all-animating presence.</p>

<p>When the battle began in the morning, I was
at Hagerstown. It was ten miles to the field,
but though so far, the cannonade seemed very
near. It rolled along the valley and rumbled
among the mountains. The people left their
breakfasts, and climbed the hills and steeples to
behold the battle-cloud. The women were pale,
and stood with tearful eyes, forgetting their
household cares.</p>

<p>A ride directly down the Sharpsburg pike would
have taken me to the rear of Lee's army. It
would be a new and interesting experience to
witness the fight from that side. I started down
the pike, my horse upon the gallop. A mile out
of town I met a farmer.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" he asked.</p>

<p>"To see the battle."</p>

<p>"You will run right into the Rebels if you
keep on."</p>

<p>"That is what I want to do. I want to see
the battle from their side."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let me advise you not to go. I was in their
clutches yesterday. They threatened to take me
to Richmond. They stole my horse and my
money, and I am glad enough to get clear. Let
me advise you again not to go. You had better
go down to Boonesboro', and see the battle from
our side."</p>

<p>It was good advice, and I was soon upon the
Boonesboro' road.</p>

<p>I came across a Rebel soldier lying at the foot
of an oak-tree. He was weak with sickness,
worn down by long marches, and had dropped
from the ranks. He belonged to Longstreet's
corps. He was too weak to speak. His breathing
was short and quick and faint. His cheeks
were hollow, his eyes sunken. Two kind-hearted
farmers came and took him into a house.</p>

<p>"I am sorry I came up here to fight you," he
whispered. He had lain beneath the oak a day
and a night, waiting death, expecting no help or
mercy from any one. The unexpected kindness
filled his eyes with tears.</p>

<p>Striking off from the turnpike I galloped across
the fields, through woods, over hills and hollows,
reached the Antietam, crossed it by a ford, and
ascended the hill to Hoffman's farm.</p>

<p>Sedgwick and Williams were fighting to hold
their ground. It was a terrific fire. There were
heavy surges, like breakers upon the sea-beaches,
like angry thunder in the clouds,&mdash;ripples, rolls,
waves, crashes! It was not like the voice of
many waters, for that is deep, solemn, sweet,
peaceful; the symbol of the song of the redeemed
ones, which will ascend forever before the throne
of God, when all war shall have ceased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a fearful contest in front of Sumner.
Miller's cornfield was all aflame. The woods by
the church smoked like a furnace. Hooker's
cannon were silent, cooling their brazen lips after
the morning's fever; but the men stood beside the
guns, looking eagerly into the forest beyond the
turnpike, watching for the first sign of advance
from the Rebels.</p>

<p>All the houses and barns near Hoffman's were
taken for hospitals. There were thousands of
wounded. Long lines of ambulances were coming
down from the field. The surgeons were at
work. It was not a pleasant sight to see so
many torn, mangled arms, legs, heads; men
with their eyes shot out, their arms off at the
shoulders, their legs broken and crushed by cannon
shot. But they were patient, cheerful, and
hopeful. The nurses and attendants made them
comfortable beds of straw upon the ground. The
agents of the Sanitary and Christian Commissions
gave them coffee and crackers. Many a noble
hero said, "I thank you! God bless you!"</p>

<p>In the hollow between Poffenberger's and Hoffman's
were the Pennsylvania Reserves, what was
left of them. Once they were fifteen thousand;
now, a remnant. They were sad, but not disheartened.
"We have had a terrible fight," said
one. "Yes, and we thrashed the Rebels. Joe
Hooker knows how to do it," another said. "We
are badly cut up, though. We can't lose many
more, because there ar'n't many more to lose,"
said the first.</p>

<p>"I am sorry Hooker is wounded. We had
licked the Rebels fairly when he left the field.
I guess they won't put us in again to-day; we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
have done our share; but if they do, we are
ready," said the others.</p>

<p>The shells and solid shot from the Rebel batteries
in the woods north of the church were dropping
around us.</p>

<p>"See there! see it tear the ground!" one
shouted, and pointed towards the spot where a
solid shot was throwing up the earth. "The man
who owns that land is getting his plowing done
for nothing," said another.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>Another shot struck near a soldier, and covered
him with earth. "Fire away! you can't do that
again, I'll bet," he said, as he brushed the dirt
from his clothes.</p>

<p>"Stand by the guns!" was the quick, imperative
order. The men sprang to their feet. Those
who were at the spring, in the hollow of the field,
filling their canteens, came to the lines upon the
run.</p>

<p>"What's up?" asked an officer. "The Rebels
are massing in front, and it looks as though they
were going to attack."</p>

<p>"Gibbons's brigade is across the turnpike; he
will hold them, I reckon," said another officer.</p>

<p>I rode up on the hill in rear of Poffenberger's.
Captain Gibbons was in front of his battery, looking
across the turnpike into the woods.</p>

<p>"It is a little risky for you to be on horseback.
Do you see that fence over there?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, the Rebel skirmishers are there, and we
are in easy range. If you want to get a sight of
them, you had better dismount, tie your horse,
and creep down under the shelter of this fence."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>The cannon balls were thick upon the ground,
and there were pools of blood where the artillery
horses had fallen.</p>

<p>"This was a warm place an hour ago, and may
be again; for I see that the Rebels are up to
something over there."</p>

<p>I look as he directs, and see a column of troops
moving through the woods. They are in sight
but a moment. I walk along the line, past Gibbons's,
Cooper's, Easton's, Durrell's, Muma's,
and Gerrish's batteries, to Poffenberger's barn.
Gerrish's battery is very near the building. The
gunners are tired with their morning's work, and
are sound asleep under the wheat-stacks, undisturbed
by the roar a half-mile distant, where
Sedgwick is at it, or by the shot and shells which
scream past them.</p>

<p>Dead and wounded men are lying in Poffenberger's
door-yard. The ground is stained with
blood. Two noble white horses are there, one
with his head smashed, the other with his neck
torn,&mdash;both killed by the same shot. There are
dead men in the turnpike. Gibbons's brigade is
behind the stone wall. The toll-house is riddled
with bullets. There are flattened pieces of lead
among the stones. The trees are scarred. There
are fragments of shells. The ground is strown
with knapsacks, guns, belts, canteens, and articles
dropped in the fight.</p>

<p>"I guess you are about near enough. This is
the front line," says a soldier.</p>

<p>I think so, too, for the bullets are singing over
our heads and past us. I go up through the
woods, south of Poffenberger's, to Miller's cornfield.
The contest has lost some of its fury. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
Rebels have been repulsed, and both sides are taking
breath.</p>

<p>Mansfield's corps is in the woods, east of Miller's.
Sedgwick's division is in the cornfield, behind
the batteries of Cothran, Woodruff, Mathews,
and Thompson. The batteries are pouring a constant
stream of shells into the woods beyond the
church.</p>

<p>The Union loss has been very heavy,&mdash;Hooker,
Sedgwick, Dana, Hartsuff, wounded, and Mansfield
killed. Meade commands Hooker's corps, and
Howard, with his one arm, commands Sedgwick's
division. He lost his right arm at Fair Oaks, but
he is in the saddle again. The Rebel dead are
thick around the church, and in the field in front
of it, and along the turnpike, mingled with those
who had fallen from the Union ranks. Five times
the tide of battle has swept over the ground during
the morning. The officers point out the exact
spot where they stood. They tell what happened.</p>

<p>"We stood out there, in the center of the field,"
says an officer of the Tenth Maine. "We came
up just as Ricketts was giving way. The Rebels
were outflanking him, and his troops were streaming
through the cornfield. The Rebels were pushing
north towards Miller's. Our line of march
was towards the west, which brought us partly in
rear of their line. Those dead men which you see
out there belonged to the Twentieth Georgia.
They were on the right of the Rebel line. We
gave them a volley right into their backs. They
didn't know what to make of it at first. They
looked round, saw that we were in their rear, then
they cut for the woods. It forced back the whole
Rebel line. Just then Corporal Viele, of company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
K, of our regiment, and a corporal of the Second
Massachusetts, dashed after them, and captured
the Colonel of the Twentieth Georgia, and a lieutenant."</p>

<p>"And Lieutenant-Colonel Dwight, of the Second
Massachusetts, captured a battle-flag," says
a soldier of that regiment, his eyes sparkling with
enthusiasm. "He brought it in under a shower
of bullets, waving it over his head. He got clear
back to the lines, and then was wounded, they say
mortally."</p>


<h3><a name="Center"></a>THE CENTER.</h3>

<p>There was a lull in the battle after the terrible
fight around the church.</p>

<p>General French's division, of Sumner's corps,
followed Sedgwick across the Antietam. The
division, after crossing the stream, turned to the
left, marching through the fields towards the
house of Mr. Muma. Richardson, as soon as he
crossed the bridge, filed to the left, moved along
the bank of the river, crossed a little brook which
springs from the hillside near Rulet's, encountered
Hill's skirmishers, drove them up the ravine, and
formed his line under cover of a hill.</p>

<p>French is in the ravine. Half of his division is
north of the brook, the other half south. He has
Weber's, Kimball's, and Morris's brigades. He
forms his brigades, as Sedgwick did his, in three
lines,&mdash;Weber in front, Morris in the second, and
Kimball in the third line.</p>

<p>Morris's men have never been under fire. They
are new troops. They have heard the roar of battle
through the morning, and now, as they advance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
across the fields, the Rebel batteries on the hills
all around Rulet's house open upon them, gun
after gun, battery after battery. The hillside
grows white. A silver cloud floats down the
ravine. They are so near that it infolds them.
There are flashes, jets of smoke, iron bolts in the
air above, also tearing up the ground or cutting
through the ranks; they feel the breath of the
shot, the puff of air in their faces, and hear the
terrifying shriek. A comrade leaps into the air,
spins round, or falls like a log to the <a name="tn_png_208"></a><!--TN: Period added after "ground" on Page 207-->ground.
They behold a torn and mangled body. They
saw not the shot which wounded him. It is a
terrible experience, yet they bear the trial firmly.
They drop upon the ground while the lines are
forming, and the shells do them little damage.</p>

<p>Hill has his front line in the ravine by Muma's.
The Rebel soldiers have an excellent opportunity
to fill their canteens from the cool water bubbling
up from his spring-house. The sharpshooters are
in Muma's chambers, firing from the windows at
French's troops as they advance over the field
east of the house. There is a graveyard east of
the house, and the skirmishers lie behind the
graves, their muskets resting upon the white headstones.</p>

<p>French's division joins Sedgwick's; it faces
southwest, while Richardson's faces west. French
arrives while Sedgwick is having the great struggle
in front of the church. Kirby's, Bartlett's,
and Owen's batteries of Sedgwick's division are
on the hillside east of Miller's field, raking the
Rebel lines.</p>

<p>The Rebels occupying Muma's house and barn
annoy Sumner's artillerymen, who in turn aim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
their guns at the buildings. A shell bursts in the
barn and sets it on fire. A black cloud rises.
The flames burst forth. The Rebels, finding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
place too hot for them, apply the torch to the
house, and retreat to Rulet's orchard. The dark
pillar of cloud, the bright flames beneath, the constant
flashing of the artillery, and the hillsides
alive with thousands of troops, their banners waving,
their bayonets gleaming, is a scene of terrible
grandeur.</p>

<p>Weber's brigade advances steadily, throwing
down the fences, scaling the stone-walls, preserving
a regular line. Not so with Morris's, which
is thrown into confusion. The time has come to
strike a great blow.</p>

<p>"Tell General Kimball to move to the front,
and come in on the left of Weber," was French's
order to General Kimball.</p>

<p>The brigade swings towards the south, past
Morris's brigade, enters the ravine, and pushes on
towards Rulet's.</p>

<p>It is a magnificent movement. Richardson at
the moment is crowning the hill south of the
brook, while Tidball's battery is throwing shells
up the ravine into the orchard beyond Rulet's.</p>

<p>The hills are covered with troops. Far up the
hillside in Rulet's, Muma's, and Dr. Piper's cornfields
are Longstreet's and D.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Hill's troops.
On the hills south of Sharpsburg is A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;Hill,
just arriving from Harper's Ferry. The Rebel
infantry is behind the stone walls and rail fences.
All of the hills are smoking with artillery. Jackson's
batteries by the church are still thundering
at Howard, who, now that Sedgwick has been
carried from the field, commands that division of
Sumner's corps. Burnside's batteries by the
bridge are all in operation.</p>

<p>Mr. Rulet and Mr. Muma live about half a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
mile from the Hagerstown pike. A narrow path
leads along the hillside to the pike. Just beyond
Mr. Muma's, the road is sunk below the surface
of the ground. It has been used many years, and
has been washed by rains, forming a natural rifle-pit,
in which D.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Hill posts his first line. Between
this pathway and the pike is a cornfield,
in which he stations his second line. His artillery
is planted on the knoll, higher up, near the turnpike.</p>

<p>It is but a few rods from Muma's to the road.
"Bloody Lane," the inhabitants call it now. The
distance from Rulet's is less. There is an apple-orchard
west of Rulet's house. Beyond that the
ground rises sharp and steep. It is a rounded
knoll, sloping towards the west into the sunken
path.</p>

<p>The line of advance taken by Weber carries
him directly towards the smoking ruins of Muma's
buildings, while Kimball passes between
Muma's and Rulet's.</p>

<p>It is a gallant advance which they make.
Weber's troops move over the mown field, past the
burial-ground, leaping the fences. Some of the
men pause a moment, rest their rifles on the rails
and the tombstones, and take a long shot at the
dark line in the cornfield. They cannot see the
nearer line of Hill's division, lying close in the
hidden road.</p>

<p>Kimball, a little farther south, joining his right
to Weber's left, sweeps on in splendid order past
Muma's spring-house, his left wing touching the
apple-trees around Rulet's. The Rebel cannon
on the hills are sending down a steady stream of
shells. The Union batteries east of the Antietam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>&mdash;the
twenty-pounder Parrotts&mdash;are throwing
rifled shot in reply. Richardson's batteries on the
hillock beyond the ravine are firing from the
southeast, while Kirby, Owen, Thompson, and
Bartlett, are raining all kinds of shot from the
north. It is a tumultuous roar. Under cover of
this tremendous fire, French moves up the hill.
His men reach the crest, and stand within ten
rods of the sunken road. There is a rail fence
between them and the road. Suddenly, thousands
of men seem to grow out of the ground. The long
line rises. The Rebels thrust the muzzles of their
muskets between the rails. The work of death
begins. French's men, instead of fleeing from this
unexpected foe, intrenched in so strong a position,
rush with a loud hurrah towards the fence. Hundreds
fall while running, but those who survive
pour their fire into the road. The combatants
are not ten paces apart. Hill's line in the road is
consumed like a straw in a candle's flame. It
melts like lead in a crucible. Officers and men go
down, falling in heaps. The few who are left
after the tremendous volleys flee into the cornfield,
towards the turnpike. French's men are
wild with the enthusiasm which comes with success.
They tear away the rails, leap over the
fence, plunge into the road, trampling down
the dying and dead, over the second fence, into
the cornfield, and rush upon the second line with
uncontrollable fury, scattering it, breaking it,
like a bundle of brittle fagots. It is a terrible
struggle. There are hand to hand fights in the
corn-rows; Union and Rebel fall together, literally
in heaps, like sticks of wood tossed together by
choppers!</p>

<h3><a name="Richardson"></a>RICHARDSON'S ATTACK.</h3>

<p>While French was thus dealing with General
D.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Hill, Richardson was engaging Longstreet.
Richardson crossed the Antietam about ten
o'clock. He marched down the western bank,
across the farm of Mr. Newkirch, crossing the
little stream coming down from Rulet's.</p>

<p>He moved to gain the high knolls between
Rulet's and the Boonesboro' road. Having crossed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
the brook, he faced west, drove in the Rebel
pickets, and ascended the nearest knoll.</p>

<p>All of Longstreet's batteries opened upon him,
but his men moved round the hillock, through
the hollows, and marched well up to the Rebel
lines with little loss. General Meagher, with his
Irish brigade, was on the right, the tip of its wing
touching Rulet's garden. Caldwell's brigade was
on the left, reaching down nearly to the Boonesboro'
turnpike. Brooks's brigade was in reserve.</p>

<p>Longstreet's batteries were on the hills around
Dr. Piper's, and his troops a part of them in the
pathway, the upper end of which was held by
D.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Hill. His line was so formed, and such
was the ground, that Caldwell, instead of swinging
round upon Sharpsburg, was obliged to fall in
rear of Meagher, and become a second line, instead
of a part of the first.</p>

<p>It was eleven o'clock when Richardson moved
forward. French was pouring in his volleys north
of Rulet's, and now Meagher, climbing the knolls,
and rushing up the ravines, came upon the Rebels
in the road. It was a repetition, or rather a continuation,
of the terrible scene then enacting a
few rods further north,&mdash;hundreds falling at every
discharge. The courage of the Irish brigade did
not flag for an instant. They fought till their
ammunition was exhausted. They drove the
Rebels from the road and held it. Again and
again Longstreet endeavored to recover it, but
could not succeed.</p>

<p>General Richardson was wounded and carried
from the field. General Meagher was bruised by
the falling of his horse. His men worn, exhausted,
half their number killed and wounded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
were withdrawn. He retired by breaking ranks
and filing to the rear, Caldwell's troops filing to
the front at the same moment and taking their
places. It was done as deliberately as a dress
parade.</p>

<p>The ground towards the Boonesboro' pike is
very much broken. There are numerous hillocks
and ravines, cornfields, stone walls, and fences.
Under shelter of these, Longstreet stealthily
moved a division to attack Caldwell's right flank
in the cornfield west of the sunken road. It was
a part of the force attacking French. Brooks's
brigade went upon the run up the ravine, and
filled the gap between Caldwell and Kimball, and
held it against all the assaults of the enemy.</p>

<p>On Caldwell's left, the sunken road winds
among the hills. The Rebels still held that section.
Colonel Barlow reconnoitered the ground.
He commanded the Sixty-first and Sixty-fourth
New York regiments. He ordered them to march
by the left flank. They pushed out into the fields
towards Sharpsburg, gained the rear of the Rebels
still holding the road, and forced three hundred
to surrender. He also captured their stand of
colors.</p>

<p>There is once more a lull in the battle. Longstreet
is making preparations to regain his lost
ground. Having failed on French's right, by
Rulet's, he renews the attack on the left. But
Colonel Cross of the Fifth New Hampshire, who
has watched with eagle eye the Indians of the
western plains, who has tracked the grizzly bears
of the Rocky Mountains, who is brave as well as
vigilant, discovers the movement. It is the
same which has been successful against Sedgwick.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
The left of Caldwell is far advanced towards Dr.
Piper's, when Colonel Cross discovers the Rebel
force making a rapid movement to gain a hill in
his rear. He changes front, and moves his regiment
to gain the hill. The two lines are within
close musket range. They make a parallel movement,
firing as they run. It is an exciting race.
Colonel Cross cheers his men, and inspires them
with his own untamable enthusiasm. He gains
the hill, faces his troops towards the enemy, and
delivers a volley. It checks their advance a moment,
but, rallied by the officers, they rush on,
charging up the hill. Cross, reinforced by the
Eighty-first Pennsylvania, which has followed
him, gives the word.</p>

<p>"At them, boys!" He leads the counter
charge. His troops rush down the hill. The
Rebels do not wait their coming, but break in
confusion. Another stand of colors, those of
the Fourth North Carolina, and more prisoners,
are the trophies.</p>

<p>Again Longstreet tries to drive back the center,
and regain the road; and again Barlow repulses
him, charging up through the cornfield, almost
up to the Hagerstown turnpike, and gaining Dr.
Piper's house. Vincent's and Graham's batteries
gallop to the hills south of Rulet's, wheel into
position, and reply to the batteries on the hills
along the turnpike, north of Piper's. But the
Rebel batteries by the church enfilade the ground
west of the sunken road. Hancock, who now commands
Richardson's division, can hold his ground,
but he cannot advance. Thus by one o'clock, Lee
has been pushed from his advanced lines on the
right and on the center. He still holds the rocky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
ledges in the woods behind the church; he maintains
his position along the turnpike, and holds
the lower bridge, where Burnside is endeavoring
to force a crossing. All the while, there is a continuous
cannonade by Poffenberger's, by Miller's,
and in front of the church. There are occasional
volleys of musketry, and a rattling fire from the
skirmishers.</p>


<h3><a name="Franklin"></a>GENERAL FRANKLIN'S ARRIVAL.</h3>

<p>It was past noon when General Franklin's corps
arrived upon the field. The troops had marched
all the morning from Crampton's Pass. General
Smith's division was in advance, followed by
Slocum's. The corps crossed the Antietam, following
the line over which Sedgwick had marched.</p>

<p>The Rebels were, at that hour, moving down
from Sharpsburg to turn Caldwell's left flank.
Hancock had just taken command of the division.
He sent to Franklin for help. He was short of
artillery. Franklin sent him Hexamer's battery,
and two regiments. One of them was the Seventh
Maine, commanded by Major Hyde. They were of
Hancock's own brigade. He had tried them at
Williamsburg, at White-Oak Swamp, and Malvern.
General Hancock assigned them a perilous
duty. "The Rebel skirmishers behind the
hill are picking off our gunners. I want them
driven from that position," he said. The regiment
started towards the hill. The Rebels saw
the movement and commenced a rapid fire. Major
Hyde halted, gave a volley and marched on,
the men loading their muskets as they advanced.</p>

<p>It was a brave movement. Unsupported by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
other troops, the small body, numbering only one
hundred and sixty-five men, and fifteen officers,
struck out boldly towards the enemy. The batteries
on the hills beyond Dr. Piper's played on
them. The guns on the hill towards the church
sent down their shells. The cannon on the knolls
north of Sharpsburg sent solid shot across the ravine,
diagonally through the line. The infantry
in front of them gave rapid volleys. Shells from
the Union batteries north of Muma's, mistaking
them for Rebels, fired upon them. Yet not a man
faltered.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></p>

<p>Once more beneath the terrible storm from foe
and friend, Major Hyde halts his men, delivers a
volley, and then with a cheer dashes upon the
Rebel skirmishers, who are behind a wall, driving
them back to the main line. Then marching by
the left flank, seeking the shelter of a hill, he
keeps up a steady fire. Officers and men fight
with great bravery. Among the officers is Lieutenant
Brown. He left the classic halls of Bowdoin
College when his country called for the services
of patriots. His captain falls. The company
show signs of faltering. He springs to the front.
He is their commander now.</p>

<p>"<i>Rally, boys! Rally!</i>" he shouts. But while
the words are on his lips, he falls, shot through
the brain.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></p>

<p>The Rebels came down in great force, and Major
Hyde is obliged to fall back. Hexamer has
used up his ammunition. He has been of great
service. Woodruff takes his place. Pleasanton,
commanding the artillery, brings sixteen guns to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
bear upon the advancing troops. The fire is so
steady and effective that the Rebel line retires
without making an attack.</p>

<p>While this is taking place on the left, or south
of Rulet's, the contest is still raging by Muma's.
Hill is making desperate efforts to recover his
lost ground in the cornfield and the sunken road.</p>

<p>French has been compelled to fall back into the
shelter of the ravine by Muma's. His men are
out of ammunition, and unless reinforced must
yield.</p>

<p>It is at this moment that Franklin's two divisions
move over the field northeast of Muma's.
The men are weary with their long marching.
They have heard the battle echoing along Pleasant
Valley all the morning, and have hastened on
to aid their comrades. They cross the fields with
their standards waving. Irwin's brigade is in
advance. It pushes through the corner of the
woods, east of Miller's cornfield, passes Thomas's
battery, and reaches the open field north of Muma's.
Hill has a brigade lying upon the ground,
behind a ledge. Irwin charges them. There is a
short contest at the ledge. The Rebels yield
and retreat across the turnpike, followed by
Irwin.</p>

<p>The ground slopes gently from the church to
the east. Jackson's batteries are where they have
been all the morning, in the woods behind the
church. They have full sweep of the field. They
open upon Irwin, whose right flank is near the
church, on the ground which Howard occupied in
the forenoon. It is an enfilading fire. It is impossible
for Irwin to advance. He cannot remain.
He retires a short distance, and his men drop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
upon the ground, sheltered by the ridge from the
enemy's batteries, holding their position through
the remainder of the day.</p>

<p>The Vermont brigade relieves General French.
The Rebels have come down into the cornfield
west of Muma's, from which they have been
driven, and are rifling the pockets of the dead and
wounded. General Smith gives the word. The
Vermont brigade charges over the ground once
more, driving the Rebels to the hills along the
turnpike.</p>

<p>Slocum's division relieves Sedgwick's in the
woods east of Miller's. General Franklin, as soon
as he comes into position, orders an assault.
Slocum forms his men to make the advance across
the field where Mansfield and Sedgwick have
fought. General Sumner is Franklin's superior
officer, and he does not think it advisable to attack.
He is not always free from despondent
moods. His own corps has suffered severely.
Sedgwick has been driven. French and Richardson
are exhausted. There is a consultation among
the officers commanding the corps and divisions
and brigades, in the woods, in rear of Slocum's
line. Sumner, Franklin, Smith, Slocum, Newton
are there; also General Hunt, commanding the
artillery.</p>

<p>Franklin wishes to attack with all his force.
Smith, Slocum, and Newton second his wishes.
Sumner alone is opposed. "My plan is," said
General Franklin, "to bring up fifty pieces of the
reserve artillery, plant them here, rain shells upon
the enemy for a half hour, and then charge with
my two divisions, and break their line."</p>

<p>Gen. McClellan visits the field, and directs the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
commanders to hold their positions, but to make
no attack.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></p>

<p>Some of the subordinate commanders retire
gloomily to their commands. They disagree in
opinion with their commander. They believe that
the hour has come when the decisive blow can be
given. As good soldiers, it is their duty to obey;
but they sit down by the fence in the edge of the
woods, dissatisfied with the decision of General
McClellan. The reserve artillery is in the field
northeast, a few rods distant,&mdash;a hundred guns.
They believe that the time has come to use it.
They do not like the plan of fighting in detachments&mdash;Hooker
in the morning&mdash;then Mansfield&mdash;then
Sedgwick's division&mdash;then French, and
Richardson, and Burnside&mdash;who is separated from
the main army, and has a hard task assigned
him.</p>

<p>During the afternoon, the Rebels made a demonstration
on the right by Poffenberger's. It was
done to cover up their real intentions. I was
talking with General Howard when an officer
dashed up.</p>

<p>"The Rebels are advancing to attack us," said
he.</p>

<p>"Let them have the heaviest fire possible from
the batteries," was the reply.</p>

<p>As I rode towards the batteries on the ridge
by Poffenberger's, thirty guns opened their brazen
lips, each piece speaking three times a minute.
The dark gray masses, dimly discerned through
the woods and among the tasseled corn, wavered,
staggered, reeled, swayed to and fro, advanced a
few steps, then disappeared.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>


<h3><a name="Burnside"></a>GENERAL BURNSIDE'S ATTACK.</h3>

<p>General Burnside's task was the hardest of all.
The banks of the river by the lower bridge are
steep and high, and the land on both sides is
broken. The road leading to the bridge winds
down a narrow ravine. The bridge is of stone,
with three arches. It is twelve feet wide, and
one hundred and fifty feet long.</p>

<p>The western bank is so steep that one can
hardly climb it. Oak-trees shade it. Half-way
up the hill there is a limestone quarry,&mdash;excavations
affording shelter to sharpshooters. At the
top there is a stone wall, a hundred feet above
the water of the winding stream, and yet so near
that a stone may be thrown by a strong-armed
man across the stream.</p>

<p>A brigade of Rebels, with four pieces of artillery,
guarded the bridge. There were sharpshooters
beneath the willows, and in the thick
underbrush along the bank of the stream. There
were riflemen in the excavations on the hillside
and behind the trees. The four cannon were behind
the wall, with the great body of infantry in
support. The bridge, the hills and hollows on the
eastern bank, are raked and searched in every
part by the infantry.</p>

<p>South of Sharpsburg there are numerous batteries
ready to throw solid shot and shells over the
heads of the brigade by the bridge. If Burnside
carries the bridge, there are the heights beyond,
the ground in front all open, swept and enfiladed
by batteries arranged in a semicircle, supported
by A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;Hill's and a portion of Longstreet's
troops. A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;Hill was not on the ground in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
morning, but arrived while the battle was in
progress on the right and center.</p>

<p>General Burnside formed his troops on the
farm of Mr. Rohrbach, with Sturgis's division on
the right, Wilcox in the center, Rodman on the
left, and Cox's division, commanded by Crook,
in reserve. Benjamin's battery of twenty-pounder
Parrotts, Simmons's, McMullen's, Durrell's,
Clark's, Muhlenburgh's, and Cook's batteries
were stationed on the hills and knolls of
Rohrbach's estate during the night of the 16th.
The troops lay on their arms, prepared to
move whenever General McClellan issued the
order.</p>

<p>At daybreak the Rebel batteries on the Sharpsburg
hills began a rapid fire. The shells fell
among the troops. Here and there a man was
struck down, but they maintained their ground
with great endurance. It was a severe test to the
new regiments, which never had been under fire.
It requires strong nerves to lie passive, hour after
hour, exposed to a cannonade. But the men soon
learned to be indifferent to the screaming of the
something unseen in the air. They ate their hard
tack, and watched the distant flashes from the
white cloud upon the Sharpsburg hills. They
talked of the guns, and learned to distinguish
them by the sound.</p>

<p>"That is a rifle shot."</p>

<p>"There comes a shell."</p>

<p>"I wonder where that will strike."</p>

<p>With such remarks they whiled away the moments.</p>

<p>The Rebel brigade holding the bridge was commanded
by General Toombs. Before the arrival<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
of A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;Hill, the force of the enemy on this part
of the field was about six thousand.</p>

<p>So vigorous was Burnside's attack, that nothing
but the arrival of Hill prevented an irretrievable
defeat.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p>

<p>Burnside received his orders at ten o'clock.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a>
Hooker had been at it all the morning. Standing
by his head-quarters, Burnside could see the dark
lines moving to and fro on Miller's field. Mansfield
was going up the slope. Sumner was crossing
the Antietam. The batteries all along the line
were thundering.</p>

<p>"You are to carry the bridge, gain the heights
beyond, and advance along their crest to Sharpsburg,
and reach the rear of the enemy," was the
order from General McClellan to General Burnside.
Easily ordered; not so easily accomplished.
Burnside has less than fourteen thousand men to
accomplish a task harder than that assigned to
any other commander. He must carry the bridge,
gain the ridge, then move over an open field to
attack the heights beyond, which are steeper and
more easily defended than the ledges by the
church, or the hills west of the sunken road. It
is by nature the strongest part of the line.</p>

<p>Burnside's batteries opened with renewed vigor.
Cox, commanding the corps (Burnside commanding
the left wing), detailed Colonel Kingsbury
with the Eleventh Connecticut to act as skirmishers,
and drive the Rebel sharpshooters from
the head of the bridge.</p>

<p>A short distance&mdash;a third of a mile&mdash;below the
bridge there is a ford. Rodman's division was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
ordered to cross at that point, while Crook and
Sturgis were ordered to carry the bridge.</p>

<p>The Eleventh Connecticut advanced, winding
among the hills, deploying in the fields, firing
from the fences, the trees, and stone walls. But
from the woods, the quarry, the wall upon the
crest of the hill, the road upon the western bank,
they received a murderous fire. Crook's column,
which had been sheltered by a ridge, marched
down the road. The cannon upon the opposite
bank threw shells with short fuses. The column
halted and opened fire. Sturgis's division passed
in their rear, and reached the bridge, under cover
of the hot fire kept up by Crook.</p>

<p>The Second Maryland and Sixth New Hampshire
charged upon the bridge. Instantly the
hillside blazed anew with musketry. There were
broad sheets of flame from the wall upon the
crest, where the cannon, double-shotted, poured
streams of canister upon the narrow passage.
The head of the column melted in an instant.
Vain the effort. The troops fell back under cover
of the ridge sheltering the road leading to Rohrbach's.</p>

<p>General McClellan sent an aide to General
Burnside with the message:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Assault the bridge and carry it at all hazards."</p>

<p>It was nearly one o'clock before the dispositions
were all made for another attempt. Ferrero's
brigade, consisting of the Fifty-first New
York, Fifty-first Pennsylvania, Thirty-fifth and
Twenty-first Massachusetts, was selected to make
the decisive attack.</p>

<p>In Napoleon's campaigns, the bridge of Lodi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
and the causeway at Arcola, swept by artillery
and infantry, were carried by the bravery and
daring and enthusiasm of his troops; but the task
assigned to Ferrero's brigade was not a whit
easier than those historic efforts. The Thirty-fifth
Massachusetts had been in the service less
than a month. They were hardy mechanics and
farmers; Napoleon's soldiers were such by profession,
who had endured the trials, hardships, and
discipline of successive campaigns; but these men,
gathering in solid column at noon behind the
ridge, on this September day, had left their
plows and anvils and benches, not because they
loved military life, or the excitement of battle, or
the routine of camp life, but because they loved
their country. The Twenty-first Massachusetts
had been with Burnside in North Carolina. Their
commander, Colonel Clark, at home, was a
teacher of youth, accustomed to the lecture-room
of Amherst; but he had left his crucibles and retorts,
and the shaded walks of the college he loved,
and the pleasant society of the beautiful town, to
serve his country. He was wounded at South
Mountain, and Major King commanded them
now.</p>

<p>The men from New York left their wheat-fields
and mills, and the men from Pennsylvania their
coal-mines and foundries, to be citizen soldiers.
They have not learned the art of war.</p>

<p>The troops upon the opposite bank were also
citizen soldiers, serving the so-called Confederacy
with bravery and valor. They were sheltered by
woods, by excavations, by walls and fences,
ravines and hills. They had great advantage in
position, and confidently expected to hold the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
ground. Their commander could look down from
his head-quarters on the Sharpsburg hills, and
behold their gallantry.</p>

<p>To carry that bridge would be an achievement
which would have forever a place in the history of
the nation. Men, when preparing to do a great
duty, where life and honor are at stake, sometimes,
with clear vision, look down the path of
ages. The mind asks itself, How will those who
come after me look upon the work of to-day?
The soul feels the weight of the hour, the responsibility
of the moment, the duty of the instant.
With the truly brave there can be no faltering
then, in the face of danger. They can die if need
be, but they cannot turn from their duty.</p>

<p>Once more the effort. Simmons plants two of
his guns to sweep the hillside across the stream.
The brave and noble Colonel Kingsbury leads out
his regiment once more. The assaulting column
prepare for the decisive movement. They fix their
bayonets firmly, throw aside their knapsacks and
all that encumbers them.</p>

<p>All is ready. The signal is given. The Eleventh
Connecticut spring to their work. They
dash down to the river, firing rapidly. Their
Colonel falls, mortally wounded, but his men
fight on. Enraged now at their loss, they fight to
avenge him. The long, dark column is in motion.
It emerges from the shelter of the ridge. Again
the hillside and the wall above become a sheet of
flame. Up to the bridge, upon it, dash the men in
blue, their eyes glaring, their muscles iron, their
nerves steel. The front rank goes down. Men
pitch headlong from the parapet into the water.
Stones fly from the arches. Shells, shrapnel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
canister, tear the ranks asunder, but on, to the
center of the bridge and across it, with a yell
louder than the battle, up the steep hillside, creeping,
climbing, holding their breath, summoning
all the heroism of life, all energy, into one effort,
charging with the gleaming bayonet, they drive
the Rebels from the bushes, the trees, the quarries,
the wall!</p>

<p>The work is accomplished. The ground is
theirs, won from General Toombs, who, before the
war began, boasted that the time would come
when he would call the roll of his slaves on
Bunker Hill.</p>

<p>The Rebels flee in confusion across the field to
gain the heights nearer the town. Ferrero's men
lie down behind the wall and on the hillside,
under shelter at last. They bathe their fevered
brows, and satisfy their thirst in the stream,
while the other divisions of the corps move
down from their positions of the morning. It
was gloriously done, and the place will be
known, forever, in history, as the Burnside
Bridge.</p>

<p>General Burnside was now separated from the
main army. Longstreet held the hills east of the
town, and from his batteries there, could partly
enfilade Richardson on the one hand, and Burnside
on the other. His cannon swept the bridge
on the Boonesboro' pike. None of McClellan's
troops had crossed there. It was nearly two miles
from Richardson to Burnside. General McClellan
was fearful that Lee would cross the middle
bridge to the east side of the Antietam and cut
off Burnside; therefore General Porter's corps
was held in reserve east of the river by the heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
guns.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> But Lee would have found it a difficult
task, for Porter's heavy guns commanded the approach
to the bridge from the west. If McClellan
could not cross the bridge because Longstreet's
guns swept it, neither could Lee have crossed
under the fire of Taft, Langner, Von Kleizer,
Weaver, Weed, and Benjamin.</p>

<p>The Antietam, a half-mile below Burnside's
bridge, makes a sudden curve toward the west.
It is crossed by one other bridge, at Antietam
Iron-works, and then joins the Potomac. By
throwing General Burnside across the Antietam,
General McClellan designed not to turn the right
of Lee and gain possession of his only line of retreat
to Shepardstown, but to carry the heights,
then pass along the crest towards the right.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> But
this movement isolated General Burnside from
the army. He must hold the bridge or be cut off.
He would be in a <i>cul de sac</i>, a bag with only one
place of escape, at the Antietam Iron-works.</p>

<p>When General Lee saw the preparations of
Burnside to advance, after having carried the
bridge, he weakened his left to strengthen his
right. Hood, who was lying in reserve behind
Jackson, was sent down. Longstreet moved some
of his brigades. Jackson made a demonstration
at Poffenberger's, already noticed, to make McClellan
fear an attack at that point.</p>

<p>General Lee intended to do more than merely
hold his line against Burnside.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> By massing his
troops at Sharpsburg, when Burnside was far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
enough advanced, Lee intended to seize the bridge
and cut off Burnside's retreat.</p>

<p>Burnside's divisions crossed the stream at the
bridge and at the ford, and formed for an advance
upon the heights near the town. Wilcox was on
the right, supported by Rodman in the center,
Scammon's brigade on the left, and Sturgis in
rear of Rodman.</p>

<p>While the troops were crossing and forming,
Longstreet's and A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;Hill's batteries kept up a
constant fire of shells. Clark's, Durrell's, Cook's,
and Simmons's batteries went across the bridge,
gained the crest of the hill beyond, came into
position, and opened fire in reply.</p>

<p>General Wilcox was on the road leading from
the bridge to Sharpsburg, which passes up a ravine.
A brook which has its rise beyond the town,
gurgles by the roadside. Rebel batteries on the
hills in front of the town enfiladed the ravine,
sweeping it from the town to the river. There
was no shelter for the troops while advancing.
They must take the storm in their faces.</p>

<p>Neither was there any cover for Rodman,
Sturgis, and Scammon. The ground, from the
stone wall on the top of the river bank to the hills
occupied by Hill and Longstreet, was all tillage
land,&mdash;wheat-fields, and pastures, and patches of
corn. There were fences to throw down, hills to
climb, all to be done under fire from cannon arranged
in crescent form, pouring down a concentrated
fire from the heights.</p>

<p>The signal officer, upon Elk Ridge, five hundred
feet above the battle-field, beholds all the operations
of the Rebel army. From his lookout, with
his telescope, he can sweep the entire field. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
assistant waves a flag, and an officer, with his eye
at the telescope by McClellan's head-quarters,
reads a message of this import, transmitted by
the little flag.</p>

<p>"The Rebels are weakening their left, and concentrating
their troops upon their right."</p>

<p>The officer writes it in his message book, tears
out the leaf, and hands it to General McClellan.
He thus knows Lee's movements, the disposition
of his forces, as well as if he himself had looked
from the mountain summit upon the moving
column.</p>

<p>He can make a counter movement, if he chooses,
by weakening his own right to help Burnside, or
he can throw in Porter's corps of twelve thousand
strong, to help Burnside, by a dash upon
the center, or leave Burnside to struggle against
the superior force in front of him, move Porter
upon the double quick to the right, unite him
with Franklin, order up fifty or eighty guns from
his reserve artillery, gather the brigades of
Hooker's, Williams's, and Sumner's corps to hold
the line, while Franklin and Porter, twenty thousand
strong, fall like a thunderbolt upon Jackson,
and break him in pieces. He can adopt one
other plan,&mdash;hold what has already been gained.
He adopts the last, and makes no movement.</p>

<p>It was three o'clock before Burnside's troops
were in position for the advance. The entire line
moved, Wilcox and Crook up the ravine and on
both sides of it, Rodman across the fields south
of the highway, and Scammon along the river
bank.</p>

<p>A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;Hill, from his position, enfiladed Rodman,
who was obliged to change his line of march.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
He severed his right from Wilcox, and wheeled
towards the southwest.</p>

<p>He was obliged to make this maneuver, to meet
Hill face to face, but it brought upon his line an
enfilading fire from the cannon and infantry
nearer the town, and it opened a wide gap in the
line, which Burnside was obliged to fill by pushing
in Sturgis,&mdash;his only reserve.</p>

<p>The troops move quickly to the attack. Wilcox
and Crook sweep all before them. The Rebel
batteries which have had possession of the hills
east of the town through the day are compelled
to fall back from knoll to knoll.</p>

<p>There is a mill by the roadside, a half-mile east
of the town. The hills opposite the mill on the
right hand are sharp and steep. It is about half
a mile across the fields to the Boonesboro' pike,
where Richardson's left has been struggling to
gain a foothold.</p>

<p>The Rebel batteries, which have been thundering
all day from these hillocks between the
Boonesboro' road and the highway to Burnside's
bridge, have enfiladed Richardson. They have
answered Taft, and Weber and Porter's batteries
upon the east bank of the river; they have thrown
solid shot almost to the head-quarters of General
McClellan; but now, under the resolute advance
of Wilcox and Crook, they are forced to withdraw.</p>

<p>Rodman meanwhile is wheeling in the open
field, under a fire from front, right and left, pouring
hot upon him like the concentrating rays of a
lens.</p>

<p>Hill had his own division, consisting of
Branch's, Gregg's, Field's, Pender's and Archer's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>

<p>Rodman and Fairchild's and Harland's brigades;
Scammon had his own and Ewing's.
They drove Hill's first line back upon the second.
Fairchild ordered a charge. His troops went
across the field, through the waving corn with a
huzzah. They faced a destructive fire. One shell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
killed eight men of the Ninth New York. The
color-bearers were shot. The guards fell. Captain
Leboir seized one, Captain Lehay the other,
and led the regiment up the hill to the road leading
south from Sharpsburg. They found shelter
under the wall, and halted.</p>

<p>The other regiments of the brigade joined
them. Harland found greater opposition. His
troops were cut down by a volley from a brigade
of Rebels lying in a cornfield. They fought a
while, became confused, crowded together, and
were forced back.</p>

<p>General McClellan, from his head-quarters, can
see all that is going on, for there is an unobstructed
view of the field. He is with Fitz-John
Porter on the high hill east of the Antietam.</p>

<p>An officer rides up swiftly. He is Burnside's
aide. His horse pants.</p>

<p>"I must have more troops and guns. If you
do not send them I cannot hold my position half
an hour."</p>

<p>That is the message. Fitz-John Porter has
twelve thousand troops. They have been spectators
of the battle through the day. They have
had breakfast and dinner, and nearly two days
of rest since their arrival upon the ground. They
might be a thunderbolt at this moment. Couch's
and Humphrey's divisions will be up during the
night.</p>

<p>But they are the only reserves present. Slocum
has taken Sedgwick's place. He has not
been engaged, and his men stand with ordered
arms. Shall Porter be put in? McClellan consults
Porter and Sykes, and then replies:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tell General Burnside that I will send him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
Miller's battery. I have no infantry to spare. He
must hold his ground till dark. Tell him if he
cannot hold his ground, he may fall back to the
bridge; but he must hold that, or all is lost."</p>

<p>Porter's corps and Slocum's division of Franklin's,
eighteen thousand men in all, have taken no
part in the battle. Smith is holding an important
position. He has made one gallant charge, but
his troops are ready to fight. There are twenty
thousand men which can take the offensive, and
nearly a hundred guns of the artillery.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></p>

<p>The right flank of the Rebels is all but turned.
Wilcox is close upon the town. Rodman has
driven Hill, and is holding his ground. Such is
the condition of affairs as the sun goes down.</p>

<p>It is useless for Burnside to struggle without
supports. He fights till the coming on of twilight,
and then recalls his troops.</p>

<p>The regiments of Fairchild's brigade, far up on
the hillside, upon ground won from the enemy by
their valor, go back reluctantly.</p>

<p>"The men," says Lieutenant-Colonel Kimball,
of the Ninth New York, "retired in good order,
at a slow step, and with tears in their eyes, at the
necessity which compelled them to leave the field
they had so dearly won."<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></p>

<p>It was a necessity. Without reinforcements he
could not hold his ground, and Lee could cut him
off if he remained so far from the bridge.</p>

<p>The daylight is dying out. Through the hours
from early morning the roar of battle has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
unceasing. Four hundred cannon have shaken
the earth, and nearly two hundred thousand men
have struggled for the mastery. At times the
storm has lulled a little, like the wind at night,
then rising again to the fierceness of a tornado.
In the intervals of the cannonade, low moans
come up from the hollows, like the wail of the
night-wind on a lonely shore.</p>

<p>On the right, through the morning, the fiery
surges ebbed and flowed, and dashed to and fro,
now against the ledges in the woods, and now
against the ridge by Poffenberger's. They have
left crimson stains upon the threshold of the
church. The sunken road has drunk the blood
of thousands. The cornfields, changing from the
green of Summer to the russet of Autumn are
sprinkled with magenta dyes. The battle is at
this hour indecisive, but the artillery of both
armies put on new vigor as the sun goes down, as
if each was saying to the other, "We are not
beaten."</p>

<p>Once more the firing is renewed. Standing on
the high hill east of the Antietam, occupied by
Porter, I can see almost up to Poffenberger's.
The batteries upon the hill in rear of his house
are thundering. I can see the glimmer of the
flashes, and the great white cloud rising above
the trees, by Miller's. And there in the cornfield,
Porter's, Williston's, and Walcott's batteries are
pounding the ledges behind the church, and sweeping
the hillside. The woods which shade the
church where Jackson stands, are smoking like
a furnace. Richardson's batteries, in front of
Lee, are throwing shells into the cornfield beyond
Rulet's.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>The twenty-pounder Parrotts on the hill by my
side open once more their iron lips. The hills all
around Sharpsburg are flaming with Rebel guns.
The sharpshooters all along the line keep up a
rattling fire. Near the town, hay-stacks, barns,
and houses are in flames. At my left hand, Burnside's
heavy guns, east of the river, are at work.
His lighter batteries are beyond the bridge. His
men are along the hillside, a dark line, dimly
seen, covered by a bank of cloud, illuminating
it with constant flashes. All the country
is flaming, smoking, and burning, as if the last
great day, the judgment day of the Lord, had
come.</p>

<p>Gradually the thunder dies away. The flashes
are fewer. The musketry ceases, and silence
comes on, broken only by an occasional volley,
and single shots, like the last drops after a
shower.</p>

<p>Thirty thousand men, who in the morning were
full of life, are bleeding at this hour. The sky is
bright with lurid flames of burning buildings, and
they need no torches who go out upon the bloody
field to gather up the wounded. Thousands of
bivouac fires gleam along the hillsides, as if a
great city had lighted its lamps. Cannon rumble
along the roads. Supply wagons come up. Long
trains of ambulances go by. Thousands of
slightly wounded work their way to the rear,
dropping by the roadside, or finding a bed of
straw by wheat-stacks and in stables. There is
the clatter of hoofs,&mdash;the cavalry dashing by, and
the tramp, tramp, tramp of Couch's and Humphrey's
divisions, marching to the field.</p>

<p>There are low wails of men in distress, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
sharp shrieks from those who are under the surgeon's
hands.</p>

<p>While obtaining hay for my horse at a barn, I
heard the soldiers singing. They were wounded,
but happy; for they had done their duty. They
had been supplied with rations,&mdash;hard tack and
coffee,&mdash;and were lying on their beds of straw.
I listened to their song. It was about the dear
old flag.</p>

<div class="centerpoem">

<p>Then there came thoughts of home, of loved

song:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>There was sadness, but not discouragement. It
was the welling up of affection, the return of
sweet recollections, which neither hardship, suffering,
privation, or long absence could efface.
They loved home, but they loved the old flag better.
Missed at home? Ah! how sadly!</p>

<p>Each division had its own artillery, which is
enumerated in the above statement.</p>

<p>There were twelve thousand four hundred and
sixty-nine killed, wounded, and missing from McClellan's
army in this battle. About two thousand
of them were killed, and nine thousand five
hundred missing.</p>

<p>The Rebel loss is supposed to have been about
fifteen thousand.</p>

<p>Thirteen guns, fifteen thousand small arms, six
thousand prisoners, and thirty-nine colors were
taken from the Rebels at Antietam, South Mountain,
and Crampton's Pass.</p>

<p>The army expected a renewal of the attack on
the morning of the 18th. It was a beautiful day.
Two divisions, Couch's and Humphrey's, had arrived,
which, with Porter's corps and Slocum's
division of Franklin's, were fresh. Smith had
been engaged but a short time on the 17th. There
were nearly thirty-five thousand troops which
could be relied upon for a vigorous attack. The
reserve artillery could be brought in. There were
several thousand Pennsylvania militia at Hagers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>town,
not of much account for fighting, but which
could be used for train guards.</p>

<p>"Whether to renew the attack on the 18th, or
to defer it, even with the risk of the enemy's
retirement, was the question with me," says
General McClellan.</p>

<p>He deliberated, and decided not to attack for
the reasons, that, if he lost the battle, Lee could
march on Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia,
and New York, without an enemy to oppose him,
living on the country; the troops were tired; and
the supply trains were in the rear. Sedgwick's
division and Hooker's corps were somewhat demoralized
and scattered. Sumner thought Sedgwick's
division could not be relied upon to attack
the enemy vigorously. Meade commanding
Hooker's corps, said his troops could resist better
than make an attack. The efficiency of the troops
was good as far as it went.</p>

<p>"The morale of some of the new troops under
Burnside was impaired," says General McClellan.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></p>

<p>"My command was in good condition, holding
its position on the opposite side of Antietam.
One brigade had been severely handled, but I considered
it in fighting condition," says General
Burnside.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></p>

<p>General McClellan expected fourteen thousand
more men, and taking all things into consideration
he decided not to renew the attack.</p>

<p>General Lee's army had seen great hardship.
The Rebels had marched from Richmond. "One
fifth of them were barefoot, one half of them in
rags, and the whole of them famished," writes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
Pollard the Southern historian.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> Lee was far
from his supplies. He had no reinforcements at
hand. His troops were much exhausted. A.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;Hill had marched with great rapidity from Harper's
Ferry. Jackson's corps had suffered as severely
as Hooker's. D.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;Hill had lost more than
Sedgwick. Longstreet could hardly be a match
for French, Richardson, and the whole of Franklin's
corps. Lee, if defeated, had a great river
in his rear which must be crossed at one ford,
which would give McClellan the shortest line to
Richmond. Sigel was in front of Washington.
Heintzelman was at Alexandria. Keyes was at
Yorktown. Could not these forces cut off his retreat
to Richmond? He was in a perilous situation.
He sent his wounded across the Potomac
to Martinsburg and Winchester,&mdash;also his wagons,
and made preparations for a rapid movement of
his army into Virginia.</p>

<p>Early in the morning I rode to the right, came
upon the line by Poffenberger's. Rations had
been served; and the troops were in position, expecting
orders to move.</p>

<p>Colonel Andrews, commanding Gordon's brigade
in Mansfield's corps, was riding along the
line. "How are your men, Colonel?"</p>

<p>"All right. They had a pretty hard time yesterday;
but having had a good breakfast, they
feel well. We expect to advance in a few moments."</p>

<p>I talked with the soldiers. "We gave them a
good thrashing yesterday, and mean to drive them
into the Potomac to-day," said one. The sharp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>shooters
were lying in the field in front of the
church. All were ready.</p>

<p>At noon, I rode once more along the lines.
Some of the batteries which had exhausted their
ammunition in the battle had refilled their caissons,
and were waiting orders to take position.
The gunners were lying on the ground.</p>

<p>"Do you think there will be a battle to-day?"
I asked an officer.</p>

<p>"O, yes. We shall be at it in a few minutes.
We are all ready."</p>

<p>One o'clock,&mdash;the wounded men were all removed.
The flag of truce had been taken down.</p>

<p>Two o'clock,&mdash;and no order to begin the attack.
Officers were impatient. They wondered at the
delay. I rode to Elk Ridge, and went up the
mountain's side. Beyond Sharpsburg there was
a cloud of dust. Baggage wagons were moving
west. Lee's troops were in line, where they had
been in the morning, but there were some indications
of a retreat.</p>

<p>At sunset, I looked once more from the mountain.
The evidences had increased that Lee intended
to cross the Potomac.</p>

<p>The morning of the 19th dawned. Lee was
gone! He took away all his artillery, except one
iron gun and some disabled caissons and wagons.</p>

<p>Riding now over all the field, I found many
Rebel dead in the woods by the church. Among
them were bodies clothed in the Union blue, lying
where they fell, close up to the Rebel line.</p>

<p>There was one soldier whose pulse was forever
still, whose eyes looked straight toward the sky.
The ground was stained with his blood, which
had flowed from a wound in his breast. Upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
his countenance there was a pleasant smile, and
a brightness as if a ray of glory had fallen upon
him from heaven. His Bible was open upon his
heart. I read:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures;
he leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth
my soul; he leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though
I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil, for thou art with me; thy rod
and thy staff, they comfort me."</p>

<p>I could not discover his name. He was unknown
to the living. He belonged to a New York
regiment, that was all I could learn. Doubtless
the Lord was with him when he passed through
the valley.</p>

<p>The slaughter had been terrible in the sunken
road, where French and Richardson had charged.
Across the fences, twenty thousand muskets had
flashed. Williston's, Walcott's, Owen's, and
Ayer's batteries had made terrible havoc in the
ranks of Hill. Some of the enemy had fallen
towards the advancing columns; some were lying
across the fence behind them, shot while endeavoring
to escape; some were killed while loading
their guns; one while tearing the cartridge with
his teeth. He had died instantly, and the cartridge
was in his hand.</p>

<p>There was an officer still grasping his sword.
He had fallen while cheering his men, with all
his muscles set, his nerves under tension, the
word of command on his lips. It was a fearful
sight along that road. It was as if a mighty
mower had swept them down at a single stroke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>Sharpsburg was full of Rebel wounded. I conversed
with an officer of Walker's command.</p>

<p>"I have been in all the battles before Richmond
and at Manassas, but I never experienced such a
fire as you gave us yesterday," he said.</p>

<p>"I noticed that you lost heavily at the sunken
road."</p>

<p>"Yes. It was a terrible slaughter. We couldn't
keep our ranks closed, and if your troops had
pressed on they might have broken through our
line."</p>

<p>"They came pretty near it as it was, did they
not?"</p>

<p>"Yes. We were all tired out. We got up from
Harper's Ferry on the morning of the battle. We
had no supper Tuesday, marched all night, had
no breakfast, and went right into the fight as soon
as we reached the field. We have lived on green
corn and apples half of the time since we left
Richmond. Half of our men are barefoot. We
were in no condition to fight. We wondered that
McClellan did not renew the battle yesterday.
We expected it."</p>

<p>General McClellan was at the hotel, looking
careworn and troubled. Lee was beyond his
reach. The army was pouring through the town.
Some soldiers cheered him as they passed, while
others expressed their dissatisfaction because Lee
had escaped.</p>

<p>The invasion of the North was ended. Neither
Washington nor Baltimore had fallen into the
hands of the Rebels. Lee had not dictated terms
of peace in Independence Square. Maryland had
not responded to the call to join the Confederacy.</p>

<p>The dreams indulged at the South of an upris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>ing
of the people of the State had proved delusive.
Lee had captured Harper's Ferry through the
incompetency of the commander of the place.
That was the only material advantage gained.
He had won a victory at Groveton, through the
treasonable failure of General Porter to join
General Pope, and the tardiness of General McClellan's
withdrawal from the Peninsula, but had
been defeated at South Mountain and Antietam.</p>

<p>General Lee retreated to Martinsburg and Winchester
to rest his exhausted troops. General McClellan
marched to Harper's Ferry and Berlin,
on the Potomac, and went into camp. Lee could
not take the offensive. His troops were worn
and disheartened. They had marched with great
rapidity; fought at Groveton; had moved on
to Maryland; fought, some of them at South
Mountain, others at Harper's Ferry; had lived
on short rations, making up the lack of food
with green corn. They were barefoot and ragged.
They slept without tents or blankets. They
were exposed to all the storms. The men of
Georgia and Alabama and Texas shivered with
the ague in the keen air of the mountains through
the October nights. Some of them, for the first
time in their lives, beheld the beautiful spangles
of the hoar-frosts. At Winchester, in the heart
of one of the loveliest and most fertile valleys in
America, they were in want of food. Lee seized
all the forage and provisions he could find among
the farmers. He was obliged to wagon his supplies
from Culpepper, eighty miles distant, over
roads which became muddy after a half-hour's
rain.</p>

<p>General McClellan, on the other hand, received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
his supplies by rail within a mile or two of his
camp. He thought that the army was not in
condition to undertake another campaign; nor to
bring on another battle, unless it had great advantages
over the enemy.</p>

<p>"My present purpose," he wrote to General
Halleck on the 27th, "is to hold the army about
as it is now, rendering Harper's Ferry secure, and
watching the river closely, intending to attack the
enemy should he attempt to cross."</p>

<p>President Lincoln visited the army, and urged
General McClellan to attack Lee. There was a
favorable opportunity. Large reinforcements had
been received, and the troops were in good spirits;
the weather was favorable. Lee was far from his
supplies; his army was smaller than McClellan's.
But General McClellan was not disposed to move.
On the 6th of October, he received orders from
General Halleck to cross the Potomac and give
battle to the enemy, or drive him south. "You
must move while the roads are good," was the
telegram.</p>

<p>Some of the troops needed clothing, and were
in want of shoes. The cavalry were deficient of
horses. Complaint was made that supplies were
withheld.</p>

<p>"The railroads are now embarrassed to supply
you; and supplies here wait for the return of
cars detained while loaded near your position,"
was the telegram of General Meigs from <a name="tn_png_247"></a><!--TN: "Washinton" changed to "Washington" on Page 246-->Washington.</p>

<p>On the 10th of October, General Stuart with
two thousand Rebel cavalry crossed the Potomac,
near the town of Hancock; visited Chambersburg,
Pennsylvania, turned toward the east, rode round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
McClellan's army, and escaped with little loss
into Virginia. General McClellan's plans for his
capture failed. The army was mortified, and the
people indignant; but the raid, although nothing
came of it, gave great pleasure to the Rebels.</p>

<p>President Lincoln sent a friendly letter to
General McClellan.</p>

<p>"You remember," he wrote, "my speaking to
you, of what I called your over-cautiousness.
Are you not over-cautious when you assume,
that you cannot do what the enemy is constantly
doing? Should you not claim to be, at least, his
equal in power, and act upon the claim? As I
understand, you telegraph General Halleck, that
you cannot subsist your army at Winchester,
unless the railroad from Harper's Ferry to that
point be put in working order. But the enemy
does now subsist his army at Winchester, at a
distance twice as great from railroad transportation
as you would have to do without the railroad
last named. Again, one of the standard maxims of
war, as you know, is to operate upon the enemy's
communications as much as possible without exposing
your own. You seem to act as if this
applies <i>against</i> you, but cannot apply in your
<i>favor</i>. Change positions with the enemy, and
think you not, he would break your communications
with Richmond within the next twenty-four
hours? You dread his going into Pennsylvania.
But if he does so in full force, he gives
up his communications to you absolutely, and
you have nothing to do but to follow and ruin
him; if he does so with less than full force, fall
upon and beat what is left behind all the easier....
You know, I desired but did not order you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
to cross the Potomac below, instead of above, the
Shenandoah and Blue Ridge. My idea was, that
this would at once menace the enemy's communications,
which I would seize, if he would
permit. If he should move northward, I would
follow him closely, holding his communications.
If he should prevent our seizing his communications
and move toward Richmond, I would press
closely to him, fight him, if a favorable opportunity
should present, and at least try to beat
him to Richmond on the inside <a name="tn_png_249"></a><!--TN: Quote removed after "track." on Page 248-->track.</p>

<p>"I say 'try.' If we never try we never shall
succeed. If he make a stand at Winchester,
moving neither north nor south, I would fight
him there, on the idea that if we cannot beat him
when he bears the wastage of communication to
us, we never can when we bear the wastage of
going to him. This proposition is a simple truth,
and is too important to be lost sight of for a
moment.</p>

<p>"As we must beat him somewhere, or fail
finally, we can do it, if at all, easier near us, than
far away. If we cannot beat the enemy where he
now is, we never can, he again being within the
intrenchments of Richmond."<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></p>

<p>The army numbered one hundred and twenty-three
thousand men present and fit for duty. If
General McClellan moved east of the Blue Ridge
he was to receive thirty-five thousand reinforcements
from Washington, making a total of
about one hundred and sixty thousand.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> Lee's
army was supposed to number about eighty thousand.</p>

<p>General McClellan still delayed to advance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
"The troops are in want of clothing," he said.
But the chief quartermaster of the army cleared
the government from all blame. "You have always
very promptly met all my requirements. I
foresee no time when an army of over one hundred
thousand men will not call for clothing and
other articles," was the telegram of Colonel Ingalls
to General Meigs.</p>

<p>Among the wounded in the hospitals at Antietam
was a young soldier of the Nineteenth Massachusetts.
He was an only child of his parents.
He had been kindly nurtured, and knew nothing
of hardship till he enlisted in the army. He was
very patient. He had no word of complaint. He
trusted in Jesus, and had no fear of death. His
mother came from her Massachusetts home to see
him.</p>

<p>"Do you know that we think you cannot recover?"
said the chaplain one day to him. It
did not startle him.</p>

<p>"I am safe. Living or dying, I am in God's
hands," he calmly replied.</p>

<p>"Are you not sorry, my son, that you entered
the army, and left home to suffer all this?" his
mother asked.</p>

<p>"O mother, how can you ask me such a question
as that? You know I am not sorry. I loved
my country, and for her cause I came," he replied.</p>

<p>He wanted to be baptized. It was Sabbath
morning. The soldier lay upon a stretcher, and
the weeping mother knelt by his side,&mdash;her only
child. There was some water in his canteen.
The chaplain poured it upon his marble brow,
where death was soon to set his seal, and baptized
him in the name of the Father, Son, and Spirit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
Thus trusting in God and loving his country, he
passed into a better life.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></p>

<p>There was another soldier who had been
wounded in the leg. Mortification set in. The
surgeons told him it must be amputated. He
knew there was little chance for him to live, but
calmly, as if lying down to slumber, he went to
the amputating table, singing cheerfully, as if he
were on the threshold of heaven:</p>

<div class="centerpoemshort">
<div class="poem">
<span class="ia">"There'll be no sorrow there!<br></span>
<span class="i0">In heaven above, where all is love,<br></span>
<span class="i0">There'll be no sorrow there."<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>He took the chloroform, became insensible.
The limb was taken off. He never knew his loss,
for after a few hours of drowsy, half-waking
slumber, his spirit passed away.</p>

<h3>THE MARCH FROM HARPER'S FERRY TO WARRENTON.</h3>


<p><span class="firstwords">The</span> month of October passed. Pontoons were
finally laid across the Potomac. They were
down several days before the enemy moved, and
General Lee, through his scouts and spies, undoubtedly
had information of what was going on.</p>

<p>The army commenced crossing on the 27th, but
the divisions were not all over till the 1st of November.
Lee had moved a week before, and was
at Culpepper, with the exception of his rear-guard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
Stuart's cavalry, and a force in the Shenandoah
Valley.</p>

<p>Up to this period of the war there had been
but few brilliant cavalry achievements on either
side. At Springfield, Missouri, Zagonyi, with his
fearless riders, had cut their way through the
hosts which surrounded them. It was gloriously
done. The cavalry, with the army of the Potomac
on the Peninsula, had accomplished nothing
worthy of mention.</p>

<p>General Stuart, commanding the Rebel cavalry,
had audaciously rode round General McClellan's
army at the Chickahominy and at Harper's Ferry.
On the march from Berlin to Warrenton, General
Pleasanton commanded the Union cavalry.
He had the advance in the line of march. General
Stuart covered the retreat of Lee. Day after day,
from morning till night, there was an interchange
of shots by the flying artillery of both armies,&mdash;Stuart
holding his ground till Pleasanton's fire
became too hot, then limbering up his guns,
and retiring a mile to a new position.</p>

<p>The Rebels had not all left the Shenandoah
Valley. But a force of ten thousand men remained
there prepared to pass through the gaps
of the Blue Ridge, and fall on McClellan's
rear, if he left it exposed. General Hancock's
division of Porter's corps, which was nearest the
Blue Ridge, or which held the right of the army,
in its march, moved upon Snicker's Gap. Arriving
at the top and looking westward, there was
a beautiful panorama; the town of Winchester,
its white houses and church spires gleaming
in the November sun; the trees yet wearing their
gorgeous livery; the numerous camp-fires of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
enemy on the western bank of the Shenandoah;
the blue smoke rising in columns and spirals to
the clouds, the troops of the enemy moving
with their long baggage trains towards the south.</p>

<p>Captain Pettit wheeled his Parrott guns into
position on the top of the mountain, and sighted
the guns. The first shell exploded in the Rebel
line. In an instant, evidently without waiting
for orders, the men took to their heels, disappearing
in the woods. An unexpected shot sometimes
unnerves old soldiers, who never think of
shrinking from duty on the battle-field.</p>

<p>On the ridge west of the Shenandoah, two
Rebel batteries were in position, with jets of white
smoke bursting from the cannon in quick discharges.
There was a small body of Rebels east
of the river. Colonel Sargent, commanding the
First Massachusetts cavalry, was ordered to drive
them across the river. His troops deployed
in the open field. At the word of command,
they dashed down the hill, supported by a detachment
of General Sykes's infantry. The
Rebel cavalry did not wait their charge, but
fled across the Shenandoah.</p>

<p>"Advance skirmishers!" was the order of
Colonel Sargent. He had no intention of moving
his whole detachment to the river bank, but
only his skirmishers.</p>

<p>The cavalry and infantry misunderstood the
order. Their blood was up. Away they went
with a hurrah down to the river-bank. The
houses on the other side were full of Rebel infantry.
Two cannon commanded the ford, and
swept it with canister.</p>

<p>"Down! down!" shouted Colonel Sargent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
He meant that the soldiers should fall upon the
ground, and not expose themselves to the terrible
fire which was coming upon them. They
thought that he would have them rush down the
steep bank and cross the stream, and with wilder
enthusiasm&mdash;that which sometimes comes to
men when in the greatest danger&mdash;they went
down to the water's edge; some of them into
the stream. There they saw their mistake, but
they faced the storm a while, and gave volley
for volley, although ordered back by their commander.</p>

<p>Six or eight were killed, and thirty wounded,
during the few moments they were there.</p>

<p>Among the killed was the brave Captain Pratt,
of the cavalry, shot through the heart. His
pulse had just ceased its beating as I stood over
him. The blood, still warm, was flowing from
the wound. His countenance was calm and
peaceful. He had died while doing his duty,&mdash;a
duty he loved to <a name="tn_png_254"></a><!--TN: "perfrom" changed to "perform" on Page 253-->perform, for he felt that he
could not do too much for his country:&mdash;</p>

<div class="centerpoem">
<div class="poem">
<span class="i8a">"Wrap round him the banner,<br></span>
<span class="i10">It cost him his breath,<br></span>
<span class="i8">He loved it in life,<br></span>

<span class="i0">Let it silently sweep in its gorgeous fold<br></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the heart asleep, and the lips that are cold."<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>Having secured Snicker's Gap, Pleasanton
pushed on to Piedmont and Markham, pleasant
places on the Manassas Gap Railroad. Markham
is nestled easily at the foot of the mountain, where
the railroad begins its long, steep gradient to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
reach the summit of the gap. At this place,
Stuart planted his guns, and a spirited engagement
took place.</p>

<p>Pleasanton dismounted his cavalry, and advanced
them as infantry, and drove Stuart, who
retreated a mile, made another stand, and was
again driven. The last fight took place in front
of a pretty farm-house, occupied by a near relative
of the Rebel General Ashby, who commanded
a body of cavalry in 1861, and who was
killed in Western Virginia. He was the boldest
of all the Southern horsemen. He trained his
horses to leap a five-barred gate. He could pick
a handkerchief from the ground while his horse
was upon a run. He was dashing, brave, and
gallant, and a great favorite with the Southern
ladies, who called him the bold cavalier.</p>

<p>After the battle, my friend and I visited the
farm-house. Our appetites were keen, and we
wanted dinner.</p>

<p>I found the owner at the door.</p>

<p>"Can I obtain dinner for myself, and oats for
my horse?" was the question.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I reckon. That is, if my wife is
willing. She don't like Yankees very well. Besides,
the soldiers have stolen all our poultry,
with the exception of one turkey, which she is
going to have for dinner."</p>

<p>Roast turkey in old Virginia, after weeks of
hard-tack and pork, was a dinner worth having.</p>

<p>"Please tell your wife that, although I am a
Yankee, I expect to pay for my dinner."</p>

<p>A conference was had in-doors, resulting in an
affirmative answer to my request.</p>

<p>A friend was with me. The cloth was laid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
and a little colored girl and boy brought in from
time to time the things for the table. At last,
there came the turkey, done to a nice brown,
steaming hot from the oven, filling the room
with a flavor refreshing to a hungry man, after
the events of the morning. The hostess made
her appearance, entering like a queen in stateliness
and dignity. She was tall, and in the prime
of womanhood. Her eyes were jet. They shone
upon us like electric flashes. Her greeting was
a defiance. Seated at the table, she opened the
conversation.</p>

<p>"I should like to know what you are down
here for, stealing our chickens and niggers?"</p>

<p>It was the first gun of the battle,&mdash;a rifle
shot. Without any skirmishing, she had opened
battery.</p>

<p>"Your Union soldiers, your thieves and ragamuffins,
have stolen all my chickens and turkeys,
and I had to kill this one to save it. And you
have run off my niggers. I should have lost this
turkey if I had not aimed a pistol at the soldier
who was about to take it. I threatened to shoot
him, and the coward sneaked off."</p>

<p>"Our generals do not permit depredations
upon private citizens, when they can help it, but
there are thieves in all armies," was the reply.</p>

<p>"O, yes; it is very well for you to apologize!
But you are all thieves. General Geary's men,
when they were here, stole all they could lay
their hands on, and so did Blenker's, and so do
McClellan's. You want to steal our niggers.
We never should have had this war if you had
minded your own business, and let our niggers
alone."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am not aware that we stole your negroes
before the war, but, on the contrary, our free
citizens of the North were kidnapped, and sold
into Slavery. South Carolina began the war by
firing on the flag. It was the duty of President
Lincoln to defend it."</p>

<p>"Lincoln! old Lincoln! He's an ape. I would
shoot him if I could have the chance!"</p>

<p>"That would be a tragedy worth writing up
for the papers. You would immortalize your
name by the act. You would go down to history.
The illustrated papers would have sketches
of the thrilling scene," said my friend with provoking
good humor.</p>

<p>"Yes, you would do just as you have done for
twenty years,&mdash;get up lying pictures and stories
about the South. You are a pack of liars. You
think you are going to crush us, but you won't.
Never, never! We will fight till the last man,
woman, and child are dead before we will surrender!"</p>

<p>She was at a white heat of passion, pale and
trembling with rage, the tears for a moment hiding
the lightning flashes of her eyes.</p>

<p>"My dear madam, we may as well understand
each other first as last. The people of the North
have made up their minds to crush this rebellion.
They have counted the cost, and the war will go
on till every man, woman, and child in the South
are exterminated, unless they yield. We are
several millions more than you, and we shall
conquer you."</p>

<p><a name="tn_png_257"></a><!--TN: Quote added before "Never" on Page 256-->"Never,&mdash;never,&mdash;never,&mdash;never,&mdash;never,&mdash;never!&mdash;Never!&mdash;Never!&mdash;Never!"</p>

<p>It was a sudden outburst of passion and de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>fiance;
a sudden explosion, like the howl of a
bulldog. All of her energy, hate, and bitterness
was thrown into the word. Her lip quivered; her
cheek put on a sudden whiteness. I was prepared
to see the carving-knife hurled across the table,
or a dish of gravy dashed in my face. She could
utter only the one word&mdash;never! After the
whirlwind, there was a shower of tears. Then
she regained her composure.</p>

<p>"You outnumber us, but you can't subdue
us. Never! never! We are a superior people.
We belong to a high-born race. You are a set
of mean, sneaking Yankees."</p>

<p>My brother-correspondent informed the lady
that he had lived in the South; had traveled
from Maryland to Savannah, Mobile and New
Orleans many times, and was well acquainted
with Southern society in all its aspects; and that
the people of the South could lay no claim to
superiority, unless it was in following the example
of the patriarchs&mdash;sustaining the system
of concubinage, and selling their own children
into <a name="tn_png_258"></a><!--TN: Quote removed after "slavery." on Page 257-->slavery.</p>

<p>A blush overspread her features. She knew
that the assertion was true. But notwithstanding
this home-thrust, she continued: "We are not
half so bad as you represent us to be. You
Yankees, from Massachusetts and Vermont, who
go down South, do nothing but lie about us."</p>

<p>"I am not from Massachusetts, madam," said
my friend. "I am a Pennsylvania Dutchman.
I was born in Lancaster, and am well acquainted
with your friend, James Buchanan."</p>

<p>"You Pennsylvanians are the meanest of all
Yankees. You are an ignorant set. You live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
on cabbage and sour-krout. You are a mean,
stupid set of thieves as ever lived. General
Geary's men stole all my cabbages. I hope both
of you will be captured and put in prison. I
hope you will get shot. If you will stay here
to-night, I will have both of you on your way to
Richmond before morning. There is a brigade
of Rebels up in the gap."</p>

<p>"We are aware of that, and do not doubt,
madam, that you would hand us over to them if
you could, but we will keep our eyes open."</p>

<p>It was somewhat hazardous to get dinner so
near a large body of Rebels, with no Union
troops near at hand, but the flavor of roast
turkey, after weeks of camp fare, was not to be
resisted under the circumstances.</p>

<p>It would require much space to give a full report
of our "table talk" on that occasion. It
was rare and entertaining. But the dinner over,
and our bills paid to the satisfaction of host and
hostess, I said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I hope that you will be delivered from the
horrors of war. I do not wish you to suffer, but
I do hope that those who have caused the <a name="tn_png_259"></a><!--TN: Period changed to a comma after "war" on Page 258-->war,
who are now in arms, will be speedily crushed;
and when the conflict is over, I hope we shall meet
under more auspicious circumstances."</p>

<p>The storm of passion had subsided. "I beg
your pardon, sir. You have treated me like
gentlemen, and I have acted like a fool," she
replied, extending her hand, and we parted good
friends. There was, after all, a tender place in
her heart.</p>

<p>After dinner we rode on again. Stuart, instead
of passing through the gap, had turned south<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
along a rough and rocky road. Six miles below
Markham, he made another stand at a place called
Barbee's cross-roads,&mdash;roads which crossed from
Markham to Chester Gap, from Thornton's Gap
to Warrenton.</p>

<p>There was a rickety old house, once a tavern,
where travelers from the valley to Warrenton
and Alexandria found refreshment for themselves
and food for their horses. But now grass was
growing in the roads. There were old hats and
cast-off garments in the windows. The roof
was falling in; and there were props against the
sides of the house to keep it from falling flat to
the ground. The few farm-houses around were
also tumbling down. Energy, enterprise, and
industry had fled from the place; and it was as
if the curse of God was upon it and upon the
whole State. The people were reaping the inevitable
reward which sooner or later must,
according to the immutable laws of nature, come
upon those who deliberately and systematically
raise slaves for sale, as they would cattle, horses,
sheep, and pigs.</p>

<p>Stuart placed three of his guns under the locust-trees,
which shaded the road west of the old
tavern. There were two more guns on a knoll,
east of the tavern and south of it, hidden from
sight, but so placed, that if Pleasanton charged
down the turnpike, he would be cut to pieces
by grape and canister. Stuart thought to get
Pleasanton into a trap. He erected a barricade
in the road behind a knoll, which Pleasanton
could not see. He piled up wagons, rails,
plows, harrows, boxes, and barrels. If Pleasanton
charged, he would bring up against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
barricade, where he would be destroyed by the
cross-fire of the batteries.</p>

<p>But Pleasanton was cautious as well as courageous.
He came into position half a mile distant,
and opened a fire which cut down the locust-trees,
tore through the old tavern, and made it
more than ever a ruin. He kept three hundred
men in the road sheltered by a hill, and out of
Stuart's sight, ready for a charge, and deployed a
squadron of the Eighth Illinois, the Eighth New
York, and a portion of the Sixth Regulars in the
fields on the right-hand side of the road, keeping
them mounted. They faced south. He dismounted
the remainder of the Sixth Regulars,
who left their horses in the woods, and moved
round upon Stuart's left, east of the old tavern.
They saw the barricade, and told Pleasanton
what they had discovered. They commenced a
sharp fire, to which Stuart replied. He weakened
his force behind the locust-trees, and sent reinforcements
to his right to hold in check the dismounted
Regulars.</p>

<p>Suddenly the bugles on Pleasanton's right
sounded a charge. The men drew their sabers.
The sharp, shrill music set their blood in motion.
It thrilled them.</p>

<p>"Forward!"</p>

<p>Away they dashed. The three hundred men
filing from the road into the field on the right,
deploying into line, wheeling, then, with a hurrah,
with a trampling of hoofs which shook the
earth, increasing from a trot to a gallop, they fell
upon Stuart's left. The Rebels fired their
carbines.</p>

<p>The Rebel artillerymen under the locust-trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
wheeled their guns towards the northwest, but
before they could fire, the three hundred were
upon them. Instead of firing, the cannoneers
leaped upon their horses, and made all haste to
escape. They succeeded in carrying off their
guns, but left twenty-two prisoners in the hands
of Pleasanton.</p>

<p>The affair did not last more than twenty minutes,
but it was the most brilliant of all the operations
of the cavalry connected with the army of
the Potomac up to that date,&mdash;the 6th of November,
1862.</p>

<p>The orders which General McClellan had issued
to the army forbade the soldiers to forage.
If supplies were wanted, the quartermasters and
commissaries would supply them. Notwithstanding
the order, however, the soldiers managed
to have roast chickens and turkeys, and
delicious mutton-chops, legs of veal, and pork-steaks.
At night, there was stewing, frying, and
roasting by the bivouac fires.</p>

<p>One night, I found lodgings with a farmer.
He had a large farm, a great barn, and a well-filled
granary. Fat turkeys roosted in the trees
around his stables, and a flock of sheep cropped
the clover of his fields.</p>

<p>He was a secessionist. "I was for the Union
till the President called for seventy-five thousand
men to put down the rebellion, as he calls it,"
said he.</p>

<p>"Why did you become a secessionist then?"</p>

<p>"Because that was interfering with State
rights. The government has no right to coerce
a State. So, when Virginia seceded, I went with
her."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>We were sitting by the cheerful fire in his
kitchen. The evening was stealing on. There
was a squeaking among his poultry. We went
out, and were in season to see the dusky forms
of men in blue moving towards the camp-fires.
Every turkey had disappeared.</p>

<p>"I notice that you have a fine flock of sheep
yonder," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, seventy Southdowns. One of the
best flocks in the Old <a name="tn_png_263"></a><!--TN: Quote added after "Dominion." on Page 262-->Dominion."</p>

<p>"I am afraid you will find some of them missing
in the morning."</p>

<p>"I will get them into the barn," he said.
"Here, you lazy niggers! Peter, John, Sam,&mdash;turn
out and get up the sheep!"</p>

<p>He had twenty or more negroes. Those who
were called started to get the sheep.</p>

<p>A half dozen soldiers unexpectedly appeared in
the field.</p>

<p>"We will help you get up your sheep," they
said.</p>

<p>The flock came slowly towards the fold, driven
by the soldiers.</p>

<p>"Sho&mdash;&mdash;o!" they suddenly shouted and
made a rush forward. The sheep scattered
everywhere, disappearing in the darkness, followed
by the soldiers, laughing and chuckling,
leaving the negroes and the farmer astonished
and amazed. It was too dark to collect them
again.</p>

<p>Morning came. The flock had disappeared.
The nearest encampment was that of a regiment
of Zouaves. The farmer, raving over his loss,
visited it, and saw seventy sheep-skins lying
behind the wall near the encampment. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
called upon the Colonel of the regiment, who
received him with courtesy.</p>

<p>"Colonel," he said, "I see that your soldiers
have killed my flock of sheep, and I want pay for
them."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, sir. The orders are very
strict against taking anything. The quartermaster
and commissary alone can forage. I do
not allow any marauding."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, whether you allow it or not, they
have stolen my sheep."</p>

<p>"I will see about that, sir. If I find that my
men have been marauding, I will have them punished,"
said the Colonel. The regiment was
ordered to appear on parade. The men were
questioned, and all denied having killed any
sheep. The camp was searched, but no saddles
of mutton were discovered.</p>

<p>"It must have been some other regiment,
sir, who committed the depredation," said the
Colonel.</p>

<p>The farmer visited the next regiment, the
Fifth New Hampshire, commanded by Colonel
Cross.</p>

<p>"I come to see, sir, if it was your soldiers who
stole my sheep last night," said the farmer.</p>

<p>"Impossible, sir. It couldn't have been the
soldiers of this regiment. My men are from New
Hampshire, sir,&mdash;the Old Granite State,&mdash;the
State of Daniel Webster and Franklin Pierce.
My soldiers would scorn to do a mean thing, sir.
They come from a moral community. They are
above suspicion, sir," said Colonel Cross.</p>

<p>"Will you have the camp searched, Colonel?"</p>

<p>"I could not think of such a thing, sir. I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
wrong the men. I would not have them think
that I suspected them, sir. If an officer is continually
suspecting his men they lose confidence
in him. It never would do to let them mistrust
that I had a doubt of their honor."</p>

<p>The farmer visited other regiments, but with
no better success. He could not find out who
had taken the sheep. The evidence was all
against the Zouaves, the pelts being in their encampment.</p>

<p>At noon I dined with Colonel Cross. We sat
around the camp-chest, which was our table.
There was a saddle of mutton, hot, juicy, tender,
and savory.</p>

<p>"My cook has a wonderful faculty of finding
mutton, chickens, and pigs," said the Colonel,
"but I obey the injunction of the apostle Paul, to
eat what is set before me, asking no questions for
conscience' sake." As I passed through the camp,
on my way to the Colonel's quarters, I saw that
the soldiers generally were dining on mutton.</p>

<p>"You live well," I said to a soldier.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I found a leg of mutton last night.
Strange, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>He chuckled merrily and looked knowingly.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you how it was," said he. "The
Zouaves played a joke on us a while ago, so last
night we paid them. We knocked over the sheep
and divided the spoil. We kept the carcasses
and left them the pelts. That was fair, wasn't it."
He chuckled again as he thought of the fun of the
thing. "Of course the Colonel and the other
officers don't know anything about it. They never
smell round through the camp." He laughed
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the soldiers had their fun and their fresh
provisions, notwithstanding the orders from headquarters.
Few of the officers thought it worth
while to inquire of the soldiers where they purchased
their chickens, turkeys, and mutton.</p>

<p>The next day was cold, raw, and snowy,&mdash;an
unusual day in the Old Dominion. The forests
were in russet and yellow, for the leaves had not
fallen. Winter had ushered itself prematurely
into the presence of retiring Autumn. The driving
storm shut the Blue Ridge from sight. My
horse had lost his shoes. I found a blacksmith-shop
built of logs. While the smith was putting
on the shoes, I sat upon the forge warming my
feet. The wind was high, and swept through the
forest with a wild, surging roar, and came into
the shop through the cracks and crevices, drowning
the roar of the bellows. The snow-flakes
sifted through the crazy roof, which had lost
nearly half its time-worn shingles. Let the reader
sit by my side on an old box, and take a look at
the blacksmith.</p>

<p>He is fifty years old. We are reminded of the
village blacksmith described by Longfellow, whose
shop was beneath a spreading chestnut tree.</p>

<div class="centerpoemshort">
<div class="poem">
<span class="ia">"His hair is crisp, and black, and long,<br></span>
<span class="i0">His face is like the tan;<br></span>
<span class="i0">His brow is wet with honest sweat,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He earns whate'er he can,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And looks the whole world in the face,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For he owes not any man."<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>While fitting the shoes he gives a little of his
experience in life. He has been a blacksmith
thirty-five years. Last year, unassisted by any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
one, in this little dingy shop, he earned about
eleven hundred dollars; this year, he thinks it
will be about thirteen hundred! The farmers
hereabouts like his work. When we rode up, he
was fitting the axles of a two-horse wagon. He is
an excellent horse-shoer, can set wagon-tires, and
do all sorts of handy things. His business with
the farmers is a credit-business, but he has many
cash customers. His wife and his young children
live at Salem, four miles distant. He lives an
isolated life. He takes his meals at a little log
hut near by, with a free negro, but sleeps in the
shop. Summer and winter he sleeps here, lying
on the bare ground in summer, and curling up
upon the warm cinders of the forge in winter.
There is his bed, an old blanket. To-night, when
his day's work is done, he will wrap himself in
it, and lie down to refreshing sleep. Saturday
night he goes home to Salem to see his wife, and
returns at daylight on Monday. So he has lived
for fourteen years. A singular life, but not a
voluntary one. No. <i>He is a slave!</i> His owner
lives down there, in that large white farm-house,
with numerous out-buildings. Looking through
between the logs of the shop, I can see the proprietor
of this blood, bones, and brains; an old man,
white-haired, walking with a cane about his stables,
looking out for the comfort of his four-legged
cattle on this snowy day. For thirty years has
this man before me wielded the hammer, and
made the anvil ring with his heavy strokes for his
master; a thousand dollars a year has been the
aggregate earnings. Thirty thousand dollars
earned! of course it is not net earnings, but so
much business done by one man, who has re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>ceived
nothing in return. Thirty thousand dollars'
worth of unrequited labor. His wife is a
slave, and his children are slaves, sold South,
some of them. He will behold them no more.
One has taken himself up North into freedom,
and one daughter is singing of freedom in the
presence of God.</p>

<p>"How much business do you do a year, uncle?"</p>

<p>"Last year I earned between ten and eleven
hundred dollars; but this year it will be about
thirteen hundred."</p>

<p>"Of course your master gives you a liberal
share of what you earn."</p>

<p>"Not a cent, sir. I gets nothing only what
the gentlemen gives me. I haved worked hard,
sir, and master says if I take good care of the
tools and shop, he will give 'em to me when he
dies, so I takes good care of 'em."</p>

<p>"How old is your master?"</p>

<p>"He is seventy years old."</p>

<p>"I should think, when so many negroes are
running away, you would want to get your freedom,
for fear they would sell you down South."</p>

<p>"I told my master I would always stay with
him, and so he has promised to give me the tools."</p>

<p>"I should think you would like to be where
you could live with your wife."</p>

<p>"Yes, I would, sir; but they don't think of a
man's feelings here. We ain't no more than their
stock, sir! They abuse us, 'cause they's got the
power."</p>

<p>"You have some money, haven't you, uncle?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'se got about three hundred dollars.
About fifty dollars is Southern confederate
money. I'se mighty oneasy about that. 'Fraid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
I shall lose it. The rest is in Virginia bank notes.
I'se been saving it this long while."</p>

<p>"Don't you find it rather hard times?"</p>

<p>"Mighty hard, sir. Hain't had no sugar nor
coffee this long while. One of your soldiers gave
me a spoonful of sugar yesterday. You'se got a
mighty fine army, sir. There's more good clothes
in one regiment that went by yesterday, than in
the entire Southern army."</p>

<p>"Then you have seen the Southern army?"</p>

<p>"O yes, General Walker's division went down a
week ago to-day, and Longstreet went down a
week ago day before yesterday."</p>

<p>This was important information, for all of my
previous inquiries of white residents upon the
matter, had brought only unsatisfactory replies.</p>

<p>"Walker's division, you say, wasn't very well
clothed?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; they was miserably clothed. Lots
on 'em was barefoot. One on 'em offered me six
dollars for these ere shoes I'se got on, and I pitied
him so, I was a good mind to let him have 'em;
then I thought may be I couldn't get another
pair. I was 'fraid he would suffer."</p>

<p>"I should think, uncle, you would be lonesome
here, nights."</p>

<p>"O, I'se got used to it. It was kind of lonesome,
at first, but I don't have anybody to trouble
me, and so I gets along first-rate."</p>

<p>While he shaped the shoes and fastened them
upon the feet of the horse with a dexterity equal
to that of any New England blacksmith, I fell
into revery. There was the smith&mdash;stout, hale,
hearty, earning a handsome fortune for his master&mdash;robbed
of his wages, of his wife, his children,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
less cared for than the dumb beasts seeking the
shelter of the stables in the storm,&mdash;a human
being with a soul to be saved, with capabilities of
immortal life, of glory unspeakable with the
angels, with Jesus, God, and all the society of
heaven, and yet, in the estimation of every white
man in the slave states and one-half of the population
of the free states, he has no rights which a
white man is bound to respect! Men forget that
justice is the mightiest power in the universe.
There is judgment for every crime, and retribution
for every wrong. The wheels of justice never
stand still, but turn forever. Therefore there are
vacant places by many firesides, and aching voids
in many a heart, and wounds which time can
never heal.</p>


<h3><a name="Removal"></a>REMOVAL OF GENERAL <a name="tn_png_270"></a><!--TN: "McLELLAN" changed to "McCLELLAN" on Page 269-->McLELLAN.</h3>

<p>It was a pleasant march from Harper's Ferry
to Warrenton. The roads were in excellent condition;
dry and hard. The troops were in good
spirits; living on turkeys, chickens, pigs, and
mutton. They marched ten or twelve miles a day,
built roaring fires at night, and enjoyed the campaign.
The army was a week in reaching Warrenton.
General McClellan was waited upon there
by a messenger from Washington, who delivered
him a sealed envelope containing orders relieving
him of the command of the army and appointing
General Burnside as his successor. The matter
was soon noised abroad. There was much discussion
upon the subject, relative to the cause of
the removal. Some officers said that the Government
wanted to destroy the army, and had begun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
with General McClellan; others that the President,
General Halleck, and Secretary Stanton
were afraid of General McClellan's popularity;
others, that they were wearied with his delays,
and that there were no political reasons for the
change.</p>

<p>The reasons for the removal undoubtedly have
been truly stated by Mr. Montgomery Blair, who
was at that time a member of the President's
cabinet, that the President was friendly to General
McClellan, but the military authorities at
Washington and many of the officers of the army
were hostile to him. They held that his delay to
attack the Rebels at Manassas in the fall and
winter; the delay at Yorktown; the keeping the
army in the swamps of the Chickahominy; the
operations on the Peninsula, showed conclusively
that the command ought to pass into other hands.</p>

<p>The President resisted all the importunities of
those who desired his removal when the affairs
were so disastrous in front of Washington. The
success at Antietam gave the President new confidence,
but the failure to renew the attack with
his reserves; the refusal of McClellan to cross
the Potomac and attack Lee; his long delay at
Berlin and Harper's Ferry, gave great dissatisfaction.
These were the causes of his removal.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></p>

<p>General McClellan was much loved by a portion
of his troops. When he rode along the lines
for the last time, they cheered him. Some could
not refrain from shedding tears. They believed
that he was a good man, and that he had been
thwarted in all his plans by General Halleck,
Secretary Stanton, the President, and members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
of Congress; and that if he could have had his
own way, he would have won great victories.</p>

<p>There were other soldiers who did not join in
the cheers. They rejoiced at his removal and the
appointment of General Burnside. They felt that
he had failed as a commander, and that he was incompetent
to command a great army. They remembered
their hardships, privations, sufferings,
and losses on the Peninsula; they recalled the
fact, that while the battle was raging at Malvern,
he was on board a gunboat. Perhaps they did not
fully weigh all the circumstances of the case&mdash;that
it was necessary for him to consult Commodore
Rogers relative to joint operations of the
army and navy; but it looked like cowardice.
General Kearny, the idol of his division, then
sleeping in a soldier's grave, had declared it to
be cowardice or treason; and the soldiers who had
fought under the command of one who had been
in the battle-clouds on the heights of Chapultepec
and on the plains of Solferino, who had
dashed like a lion upon the enemy at Williamsburg,
Fair Oaks, Glendale, and Groveton, were
not likely to forget the sentiments of one so brave
and brilliant as he.</p>

<p>In all the battles of the Peninsula, they could
not remember that General McClellan had been
upon the field. When Fair Oaks was fought, he
was north of the Chickahominy; when Lee with
his whole army approached Gaines's Mills, he removed
to the south side of the river. He passed
White-Oak Swamp before the enemy came to
Savage Station. He was at Malvern when they
appeared at Glendale, and on board the gunboat
when they came to Malvern. They did not con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>sider
that he rode to Malvern once during the
day. Sitting by their camp-fires, the soldiers
talked over the matter. There was no disaffection.
They were too good soldiers to make any
demonstration of disapprobation. Besides, General
Burnside had been successful at Roanoke,
Newbern, and South Mountain; and success gives
confidence.</p>

<p>The soldiers were in earnest in carrying on the
war. The people were impatient at the delays
of General McClellan in the east, and General
Buell in the west.</p>

<p>Riding from the east to the west and back
again in the cars, after the battle of Antietam, I
had an opportunity to know how the people were
affected by the war. It was the last week in October.
The mountains were purple, scarlet, and
crimson, and had it not been that there was war
in the land, one might have dreamed that he was
in Eden,&mdash;so beautiful the landscape, so resplendent
the days. But there were sad scenes. A
mother bidding farewell to her son, the wife to
her husband, the father to his children, taking
them in his arms, perhaps, for the last time, dashing
aside the tears, kissing them again and again,
folding them to his heart, tearing himself away
at last, sitting down by himself and weeping,
while the swift train bore them away. It was not
for military glory, not for honor, or fame, but for
his country!</p>

<p>I saw an old man, whose head was crowned
with years. He was on his way to Washington,
to take back with him to his Pennsylvania home
the body of his youngest son, who had died in
the hospital. He had three other sons in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
army. He was calm, yet a tear rolled down his
cheek as he talked of his loss.</p>

<p>"I shall take the body home, and bury it in the
family ground. I shall miss my boy. But I gave
him to the country. I want the government to
push on the war. I want our generals to move.
I want this rebellion crushed out," he said.</p>

<p>The stout-hearted Pennsylvania farmer left the
car, and a lady sat in the seat he had occupied
by my side.</p>

<p>She, too, was advanced in life. She had traveled
all day, was sick and weary, but she had received
a letter that one of her sons was dying at
Frederick. He had been wounded at Antietam,&mdash;shot
through the breast. She had three sons;
two in the army, and one, a little one, at home.</p>

<p>"I am a widow," she said. "My husband was
a sea-captain, and was lost at sea years ago. My
boys supported me. When the war broke out,
they wanted to go, and I couldn't say no. Joseph,
the youngest, is not old enough to be a soldier;
if he was, he would be with them. I should like
to see my son once more. I hope God will spare
him till I get there; but I am not sorry I let him
go."</p>

<p>Opposite sat a well-dressed lady from Philadelphia.
She had received a message, "Your son is
dying; come quick if you would see him."</p>

<p>Tears were dropping from her eyelids. The
train was not swift enough.</p>

<p>"Why don't they go faster?" she impatiently
asked. She had a basket with wine, cordials, and
delicacies.</p>

<p>"I thought I would take them, for if he don't
want them, somebody will."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>The two mothers, the one poor, earning her living
by her needle, now that her brave boys were
in the army; the other rich, able to have all that
money can purchase, sat down together, and
talked of their hopes and fears, both longing to
clasp their loved ones to their hearts once more.
There was no complaining, no regret that they
had given their consent when their sons asked if
they might enlist.</p>

<p>There was sorrow all over the land, for loved
ones who had fallen at Williamsburg, Fair Oaks,
Glendale, and Malvern, for those who were sleeping
beside the Chickahominy, and for those who
reposed beneath the shadow of South Mountain,
and on the field of Antietam.</p>

<p>But a great change was going on in the minds
of men. They had said: "We will have the
Union as it was, and the Constitution as it is,"
not discerning that it was a war of moral elements,
a contest between right and wrong, justice
and injustice, freedom and slavery, civilization
and barbarism.</p>

<p>But they began to discern that the elements of
the contest were the rights of men, and God's
eternal laws; that the armies of the Union were
serving in the cause which had inspired Leonidas
at Thermopylæ, and Miltiades at Marathon; that
the reveille which waked the soldier from his
slumber was the drum-beat of all ages; that they
were moving, not by the force of men's wills, not
by opinions or acts of men in positions of honor
and power, but by the resistless propulsion of
God's immutable, changeless, eternal laws, which
wither, blast, and destroy, when resisted, but
which are as the dews of the morning, like sweet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
summer showers, vivifying, strengthening and
sustaining, when accepted and obeyed.</p>

<p>They mourned for the fallen, but they felt that
they had lived for a great purpose, and had not
died in vain. With defeat and disappointment
there came a sublimer trust in God. There was
a rekindling of faith and hope, a confidence,&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX" id="APPENDIX">APPENDIX.</a></h2>


<p><span class="firstwords">The</span> Army of the Potomac was organized in October, 1861.
There was a reorganization in April, 1862, and again in August
of that year. The organization of that portion of the army
which fought the battle of the Peninsula is annexed; also those
troops which fought the great battle of Antietam. By means
of this table and the accompanying diagrams the reader will
be able to ascertain in most instances the positions of the several
regiments,&mdash;not their exact locality, for regiments in battle
are often detached to other parts of the field, as reserves,
pickets, skirmishers, or guards.</p>

<p>The troops which took part in the battles of the Peninsula
were the Second Corps (Sumner's), Third Corps (Heintzelman's),
Fourth Corps (Keyes's), and Franklin's and McCall's
divisions of the First Corps (McDowell's). McCall joined the
army when it was on the Chickahominy. Shields's division of
the Fifth Corps (Banks's) was sent to the Peninsula after the
retreat to Harrison's Landing. It took no part in active operations
there.</p>

<p>In the reorganization after the battle of Groveton and the
retreat of Pope's army to Washington, the army was composed
of six corps, as described p. 175. Many of the troops which had
fought on the Peninsula were left at Alexandria, and other
troops&mdash;Burnside's, from North Carolina; Sherman's, from
Port Royal; Cox's from Western Virginia; new troops which
had been but a few days in the service, and regiments from
Wadsworth's command at Washington&mdash;were put in to fill
their places.</p>

<p>It has not been possible to obtain a complete and correct list
of all the regiments engaged in that battle. Some regiments,
after the battle of South Mountain, were detached from their
brigades, and sent on special service; others were kept in the
rear, to guard the trains; others were sent on flank movements.
But much care has been taken in the description of that battle
to give the exact position of the divisions engaged, and also the
brigades, so that it will be comparatively easy to ascertain the
general position of most of the regiments.</p>
